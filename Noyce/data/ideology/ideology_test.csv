1,"He'll be term limited out in 2026. Assuming he keeps the Governorship in 2022, the most Florida will lose is 2 years of DeSantis. I'm not sure he'll be able to keep the momentum he has now for 8 long years, especially if he's not actively governing for two of them. I trust Florida enough to vote in a decent replacement if he does win the Presidency; I know I'll do my part."
1,Perhaps they should ask why these people that fled from communist or socialist authoritarian regimes all are avoiding the current dems like the plague. They'll tell you.
0,"Not sure why the archive when it doesn't let you read what he said, when her tweets that include what sdl said are up here [

Looks like racist jokes. ""Racist comments"" is misleading. Still not cool of course, but they're two different things.

Also want to add that I will second fuck black nationalism. That shit is cancer and makes me think including it means she's a nutjob."
1,"It's isn't even any sort of awareness. The second line is the most basic argument literally every leftist makes. 

What this demonstrates is that these guys don't ever listen other arguments and just argue with strawmen in their echo chambers all day. They are dishonest bad faith arguers who only like hearing the sound of their own voice."
0,Nazis embrace being likened to Communists?
1,"Wasn't it other way around? That TDS strong that anything positive about Trump constitutes now as ""dick sucking""? Meanwhile what Fox did to Trump in comparison to other news outlets during Obama years was probably just talking nicely Trump's pepe compared to other MSM going full grapefruit blowjob on Obamas."
-1,"Allow me to disagree.  Minimum wage is directly targeted at service and low tech companies that lobby to keep it low.  

UBI is directed at citizens not companies so corporations would be called out very quickly if they tried to lobby against or otherwise thwart the system."
1,The Biden administration has kids sleeping in dirt outside dude lmfao

1,I too enjoy watching a train wreck over the train being boring and not doing insane things giving a medal to Rush Limbaugh mid speech.
0,"Yeah the riot! The one where they stormed into the capitol? Tried to get into where the senate was holding counsel? And did that coup thing where you try and overturn a democratic process by force.

That riot, you’re right same riot I was thinking of.

Early January or something? Ton of people on the mall? Stormed the capitol?"

-1,"I just really want to take this Easter to laugh my ass off at all the Trump supporters who were duped into making recurring monthly donations to the campaign, which were then doubled, without their knowledge."
-1,"Because literally every single investigation, and every single court challenge, showed as much? 
   
If there was widespread voter fraud in the last election, it's incredible that apparently dozens of courts, including judges appointed by Trump, are in on the conspiracy."
-1,Liberals sticking up for the big corporations. Again.
0,"I mean he’s come out and said he fully plans on running, so unless he dies or gets very sick in office I think you can bet on him being the candidate. And I agree that a truly progressive candidate doesn’t stand a chance in the next election, but I don’t see why we can’t discuss it for the fun of it."
0,People who use that phrase are also virtue signalling.

-1,"Just vote and help those in need. Encourage others to vote to help the needy. Appeal to conservatives by talking about our support of small and local businesses, we're generally protectionists and support a capitalist economic system. Appealing to liberals is much easier. We're usually socially progressive and tend to think that racism is bad. Know your audience and you can make a positive difference.

1,"Honest question - are you being paid to comment with pro Biden and pro covid fear mongering propaganda here? Unsettling if yes, downright creepy if no"
-1,"He'd have to be very aggressive for the $15 right now since some center-leftists don't want it nationally. Hell freaking 8 Democrats voted against it in the Senate. Seems like he's pushing for it but more methodically. It'll burn up his political capital, but fair point. 

I really didn't expect something like the infrastructure package on top of the relief package so that was a pleasant suprise that went above my low expectations."
0,"It's not a strict definition. Most would call it Ordoliberalism.

But both great parties at the time when  the Grundgesetz was written, SPD and were quite happy with that. Both still stick to it, and Germany still has a good economy."
0,"the solution that for some reason half the population thinks won't work and thus doesn't do, is to just vote for a third party. particularly one of the largest two. Libertarians and greens."
-1,"Notice how every conservative just says Antifa. They never go into what it means. Probably because if they did they'd notice that they're against amti-fascism, and there's a chance that the more self aware ones, with a shred of introspection, might ask themselves ""are we the baddies?"""
-1,No. I don't want anyone who posed a socdem then swayed into a another ideology.
-1,That person doesn’t realize they’re taking their blame out on poor people who “don’t make good choices” which to them is probably drug addiction or obesity both of which are actual health conditions. They don’t realize they should be angry at insurance companies instead. Their way of thinking is what’s wrong with America in the first place.
-1,"You’re the one who put “angry mob” in quotes like we didn’t watch it live on tv. And yes, this was worse than any riots because these people were trying to attack congress and violently overturn an election. You’re in denial.

As if a bunch of thugs rioting somewhere excuses an attempt to overthrow congress...."

Well then…

EDIT: fixed the link, sorry

EDIT 2: So the person went to private but apparently Cenk started an “unauthorized” PAC that donated to Trump"
-1,"Sorry about the titlegore, but Republicans are not trying to make voting easy."
1,"Nothing has changed. Otherwise, we would have a pile of Democrats in prison right now. The letter agencies are extremely partisan. The evidence is in who gets investigated and who doesn't.  
  
The fact that you said the double standard has been changed is not apolitical. Indeed, it's **very** political. Again, look at who is getting raided and who gets softball interviews where they're not having to give statements under oath. There's no question it's political in nature."

1,"Another Democrat using the 3 letter gov agencies to take out their rivals. Sound familiar? Let me give you a hint... Hitler, Stalin, Pol-Pot, Amin, ... get the picture? Every single/marxist regime in history has used the government agencies to take out their opposition. Their doctrine cannot stand the light of day, or criticism! It fades when exposed!

Where is the MSM? Crickets!"

1,He’s a Republican in name only.
0,"> Having Joy Reid and other Democrats acting like knife fights are just things kids do for fun isn't helping either. Apparently ""boys will be boys"" is now their argument.

0,"I definitely don't speak for all conservatives, but personally I don't have an issue with those. Coke is a bit tricky because I believe the addiction and desperation to buy more drives a lot of crime in the society."
-1,"The first can be mitigated through good welfare and labour policy (as seen in the Nordic Model), the second isn't inherent to corporations but rather to post-Industrial Revolution human society (the USSR and the Aral Sea are good examples of this), the third can once again be mitigated through good social policy without having to throw out the baby with the bathwater."

0,"Huh? I find it difficult to believe this is only at 51 percent. She had what, 1 percent of the vote when she was a presidential candidate, and she's done absolutely nothing. 49 percent of people could not possibly approve of this laughing idiot."
0,Doesn't really bother me either way...I just find the hypocrisy of it kind of funny. Republicans are supposedly the racist ones.
0,No don’t at least if he increases spending the depth will not increase so much.
-1,"now why the ever loving fuck would he do anything useful. He's a trump loving ass clown who's never done anything useful in his life. He sells garbage to morons. Just like his friend, fat idiot hitler. I mean trump."
1,"How did she cause Dems to lose 2 State Senate seats and 13 state house seats? Seems kinda hard to blame that on one Senate candidate, especially when it seems that Republicans were doing acceptably good throughout the US (flipped a bunch of House seats and whatnot). I mean, it seems her campaign wasn't great, but I didn't hear much about it being super toxic or anything."
0,"Not particularly, but I do believe that the networks that had the majority of viewers are majority Dem, so they are making a reasonable claim-- unless you think all the Trump supporters switched to channels they don't watch just to mess with the polls, lol."
1,"Fair point. The Senate went through all that trouble with their parliamentarian to determine they could run a second reconciliation bill this fiscal year to ‘modify’ the earlier reconciliation bill, and….. nothing. I typically prefer divided government because nothing gets done. Turns out single-party rule under Democrats is pretty similar to divided government."
0,"It's legitimate when he shows video evidence proving his point.

And qanon is a group that is against Trump, a little research will help, like it's right there in the description when you look them up."
-1,"Policy being passed is huge.  

Biden is pushing 2 major proposals (covid relief and infrastructure bill) that are both polling around 70% with Americans, including republicans.

Obama's big proposal (obamacare) polled around 47% when it passed."
0,I personally wish we could remove the religion from politics. It has no place in government IMO.
1,I take it you've never encountered the 50 Cent Army on Twitter before.  Go back to Twitter and write up something nice about any Republican you want and watch it get downvoted into oblivion.  Come to think of it they're also rather active on several subreddits such as as well.  Most of the ones downvoting you will be either bots or the 50 Cent Army who mainly get paid for writing pro-China stuff but they will also do it for the Democratic Party and against Republicans.

0,They claim disenfranchised voters. I say give them to Maryland.
0,"Candidates rarely file as a candidate without forming an exploratory committee first, which is what he did this morning and why he's fundraising now.

A smart finance director will drop that they're thinking of forming one, then form one, then declare, and collect the earned media of each announcement. Also the exploratory committee allows him to keep his donors secret until he officially declares.

You're essentially knocking him for doing the smart thing."

0,"Biden was declared president 4 months ago. 4 months is plenty of time. From mexicos southern border, it is 1,125 miles by foot to McAllen, Texas. At three miles an hour, that's 375 hours, or about 38 days if they walk 10 hours a day."

1,"As much as I think that Trump was a great president, I don’t want him to run in 2024. I’m tired of defending his stupid remarks. 

I’d much prefer Ron DeSantis to run. Ron is like Trump but he speaks better and has less stupid blunders. I don’t think Trump can win either, his reputation has been tarnished. 

Assuming that the 2020 election was fair, Trump lost for two reasons: 

Trump kinda abandoned the populist rhetoric that got him elected in 2016, his entire campaign strategy in 2020 was just calling Biden a socialist.

The second reason was that his blunders almost overshadowed his campaign, I really didn’t like some of his rhetoric but I still supported him.

If Trump wants to win in 2020 he really needs to bring back his 2016 campaign style and be more careful with his bad phrasing."
