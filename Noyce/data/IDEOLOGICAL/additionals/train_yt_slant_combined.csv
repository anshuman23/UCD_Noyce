2.0,"Thank you. So important to not let our like of other aspects of a person (policies, etc.) prevent us from holding them accountable to harms they‚Äôve caused."
2.0,"Although I agree Gov. Cuomo's behavior seemed inappropriate at times & probably is best if he stepped down, don't think of the accounts I've heard that anything was criminal or against the law. Maybe he will find some other work as he seems like a very decent man. Hoping the new governor Kathy Hochul will do good for the great state of New York."
0.0,"They elected a man who said he grabbed them by the p***y‚Ä¶.yeah, we have a long way to go."
2.0,I still say he made trump look bad during the first Covid and he's getting payback. I notice that women always believe women. I'm not convinced this time. I think she's (the one all over tv) is collecting a big paycheck. Just my humble opinion.
0.0,"Well said, the ""lack of transparency"", there is nothing worse than to be blindsided by a system that you trust. It should be a 2 way window with our government and it's; our officials, that we as citizens have elected to speak our voice, on our terms, our agreed terms as citizens. Thank you for your efforts, AOC all the way!"
0.0,Cuomo - give me a break - the line has moved! Only for you. We women have stood strong for so long along a line that you determined fit your needs. Your line is leading you out the door of the Governor‚Äôs mansion and office!!
2.0,We should also not elect abusers to become president
0.0,"Trump should have resigned also. Yet his supporters, wealthy white men could not let that happen. Side note, I am truly sorry for the abuse you are enduring from those around you. I bless the path you are on, and admire your perseverance in the face of assault. Be safe. Your life is too precious."
2.0,"Sometimes people don‚Äôt tell the truth, and that‚Äôs okay to admit as well. This abuser vs. abused binary is divisive and leaves 0 room for nuance. Sometimes trauma makes us believe something is happening that isn‚Äôt actually happening. That‚Äôs called psychic equivalence, and it‚Äôs a real thing, and it is not victim-blaming.
And no, that‚Äôs not the case all the time, but it does happen ‚Ä¶ a lot. We are entirely abandoning reality with these victim axioms as if there is no way on earth that there‚Äôs another side to things. THAT is just as well the first step toward totalitarianism
."
0.0,"I was so worried about how you would handle this. Need to clarify that you have no real responsibility to be vocal about business that‚Äôs not your own however as a political (really in career only‚Ä¶. And I mean that as a compliment) you have been and frequently do voice yourself opinions‚Ä¶. A lot, if not all, are not lunacy and I agree with. But as a fellow Democrat I worried you would stay silent, thank you for being unbiased by party. You are a shining example of how to be a public servant"
0.0,"And people wonder why victims don‚Äôt report right away. The response is so often that they are lying, don‚Äôt know how social interaction works, or were asking for the abuse. Can we stop allowing these powerful men to defend themselves on national television in this pathetic and manipulative way?"
2.0,"Biden said Cuomo did a hell of a job, except personally. There's the way Cuomo governed and another way he acted in a purely personal capacity that had nothing to do with being governor. And ""Our American Cousin"" was a hell of a play and a fine presentation by Ford's theater until John Wilkes Booth interrupted it halfway through. Patrons never even got their money back. And that's what's so sad, as Biden noted."
0.0,How about trump and Gaetz and Kavanaugh? Why are they not held accountable!?
1.0,We live in a hypocritical society where we rant against the police for treating certain POC as being guilty before facing justice of his or her peers in the court of law.. Are all not innocent until proven guilty in a court of law?
2.0,"Very well said. You are a true hero, not only to the district you represent, but also for all people that deserve better. We need more like you in our government. Get it, Queen."
0.0,"I agree fully, but why are only Democrats held accountable for their actions?"
0.0,Thank you. The sexual violence and abuse by powerful men can no longer be ignored.

I‚Äôm from the UK and haven‚Äôt heard any official speak about what‚Äôs happening with Line 3.

A treaty is currently being broken, US law enforcement paid by the Canadian oil company for man power.
The indigenous need help along with many endangered species that rely on that water."
0.0,Well he is guilty like the former Orange Man female genitalia grabber. And all those who cover for them are abuser too.
0.0,"For every courageous women who refuse to be abused in silence there are multiples who still live in fear and suffering, they must feel safe to come forward, also there must be sever consequences for those who help the harasser cover up"
0.0,"I'm still waiting for the media and democrats to pressure Congressman Matt Gaetz to do the same and also legally force Trump's hand to submit his DNA in a possible rape case. Cuomo resigning is a win, and his replacement looks very promising comparably, but we need to pressure the other side of the aisle enough to get similar results."
0.0,"I love this. As a fellow Democrat I'm glad he resigned but am disappointed he seemed to feel no remorse, and took no blame. We have to be the party to take the higher ground, because we know they never will."
0.0,"I‚Äôm in awe of how AOC (or the person who runs her account) can articulate the modern complexities of civil rights. I do wish he was around to progress the Trump cases,I‚Äôm hoping it gets done with the same fortitude."
2.0,I don‚Äôt agree he should not have resigned. He was good for the state and got things done. This is the first time I have ever disagreed with AOC.
1.0,"Once again, the Democrats eat their young while Republicans revel in delight. I wonder how we'll all feel when a Republican wins the governorship and Trump gets a NY pardon."
2.0,Agreed. I was disappointed in his statement about the line being ‚Äúredrawn‚Äù. It‚Äôs a face saving excuse and he needs to drop that and admit he knew he could flex his power over women because he‚Äôs been the governor. We need truth.
2.0,"Totalitarianism
doesn‚Äôt work without the introduction of delusional psychosis.
Also, narcissism."
0.0,"Thank you AOC, for helping blow the dust and cobwebs off institutions of power that have operated in the shadows for too long. Your courage is contagious and very much needed right now. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
0.0,"I agree with everything you said. But I am getting tired of the Dems always being the ones to stand up and take their own out for this type of BS behavior, while the GOP ignore it and let it continue and refuse to do the same with their own. We need to force them to do the same!"
2.0,We won‚Äôt forget how you forced Cuomo out with zero due process. Absolutely shameful. You will never hold higher office.
2.0,You need to recommrnd to your supporters what preferences to give for Mayor

1.0,"Anybody else notice that Dems have been running America‚Äôs cities and inner cities for 3-4 generations and havent fixed them yet? As a matter of fact they continue to get worse‚Ä¶worse schools, more homelessness, more crime, etc. Yet Dems want you to believe they have more, new ideas that will fix the mess they created. So isn‚Äôt voting D like the definition of insanity?"

2.0,I remember last year how you helped Ed Markey get reelected to the Senate and saw you on TV with my Congressman Seth Moulton this morning.
0.0,i love AOC...perhaps the most anti-American congresswoman in the U.S. Bella Abzug would whip her butt for all the bad things she says about the nation. I hope she gives up riding in a car or flying in a jet between DC and NYC. She should walk her way into the Green New Feel! AOC for Prez.

2.0,How about some personal accountability for the people that are breaking the law and putting themselves into this
2.0,"Please don‚Äôt continue to support the very system your party now has ostensible power over. The drones, the detentions, the platitudes about common ground with those without human compassion or decency. You were one of the few who gave average people hope. Don‚Äôt be Fredo I beg of you. Don‚Äôt break our hearts."
2.0,"Pouring gas on a fire. Investigation barely even begun. You're part of the problem, you're helping grow a ""guilty until Proven Innocent"" society. Unless it meets your agenda of course.
Shame on you."
2.0,"I am angry and appalled at the recent events involving police and deaths of young black men. With that out of the way,I am the mother of a hard working, caring, good police officer who puts his life in danger on a very consistent basis. While those that do wrong should without a doubt be punished, let's not forget that there are more good cops than bad ones. Recruitment of police officers in this day and age is a challenge and it doesn't help that they are not paid enough for what they do either. Just remember to judge the individual for their actions and not every cop on the beat. I sincerely hope to see change to make everyone safer"
2.0,It‚Äôs a tragic incident for all parties involved.. so sad he had to resist and cause the escalation.
1.0,Way to incite violence Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A mistake that cost someone their life and was admitted to by the cop. End of story.
0.0,It is always right to criticize law enforcement in the United States. People think it's a crime -- especially after -- but it's a right.
0.0,"I heard a report today that none of the Brooklyn Center police force actually live in the community. If this is true, this is also a problem. A community's police department should reflect the community in which they protect and serve. This won't solve everything, but if the police are of the people of their community, they may have a different level of investment in its people. And more good police need to call out bad police."
2.0,"Question is , what are you politicians doing about it , or do you prefer to talk just enough to get re-elected? Do what they need you to do instead of saying it if you really want to make a difference! Once election season come around we the people Hear and watch nothing but promises and no action !"
1.0,"At the same time why not educate the ppl not to flee and obey the officers orders, in most cases at the max you would be arrested, warned or cited for wrong doing. But if you have a warrant ofcourse they arrest you. Obeying officers orders was one of things I was taught by my seniors when I arrived into US into 2006. Hope the young and vulnerable learn a lesson in addition to better training and rules for the officers to bring a positive change in the society. Bashing each other and politicizing the issue will only make mattes worse. Side note that kid at 20 should be in college not parenting a 2yr old boy, thats a broader problem this cntry has to address."
1.0,Just another reminder that it‚Äôs a dangerous profession being a criminal and resisting arrest. Let‚Äôs hold the criminals as accountable as we all want police to be.
1.0,"It was an unfortunate accident. At the end of the day the main lesson that should be learned from all of these unfortunate events is, ( stop resisting arrest). It will never end well. You fight the arrest in court, not on the street. Stop pointing the finger and take some personal accountability.
If you really want to lead Ms. Cortez, then this should be your message. I know you have good intentions, but you're going at this from the wrong direction."
2.0,"Your comments are not based on on emotion and presumption. The facts in this case do not support your assertions.This is very irresponsible behavior from a public figure and I would expect that people in positions of power and influence would feel the need to hold themselves to a higher standard. Great leaders seek the facts and stand up for what is right even when it is not popular. They bring people together, they don't divide and instigate."

2.0,"The actual investigation has barely started. She admitted her mistake verbally on body cam. She resigned, she will be going to court. Ppl so negative b4 anything has even happened."
0.0,"The real way to end this type of crap is:
- Remove qualified immunity.
- Require ALL officers to carry $1M in malpractice insurance just like doctors and lawyers.
- Tie civil awards to the police retirement fund. Example: If there is a $3M award for misconduct $1M comes from the officer's insurance and the $2M comes from the retirement fund and NOT the tax payers.
- Create a national database of discredited officers (just like they do with lawyers and doctors) so if they apply for another law enforcement position their past WILL follow them."
2.0,How about people comply with the officers orders. Do not resist
0.0,"Excuse me for saying so, but it seems a bit odd that a woman who has been a police officer for 26yrs would 'mistakenly' draw her gun thinking it was her taser, if she doesn't know the difference between the two after 26yrs then she shouldn't be a cop at all and she sure as hell shouldn't be excused, or forgiven, for making such a stupid, not to mention fatal, rookie mistake..."
2.0,She should not be allowed to keep her pension!
0.0,how does a 25 year veteran not know the difference between a GUN and a Taser? O r better still how do they not know that the punishment for expired tags or misdemeanors is still NOT DEATH.
1.0,"...says the socialist who wants to increase state violence, authority, and spending."
2.0,Definitely a tragedy and avoidable. Maybe not run from the cops also. That might help
0.0,"The reason the cops pulled Daunte Wright over: He had an air freshener dangling from his mirror which was supposedly blocking his view.

I feel like that part of the story doesn‚Äôt get enough attention. Really makes you wonder if they were just looking for a reason to pull people over."
0.0,"Let‚Äôs not forget the mass proliferation of guns among USA citizens...so that police fear being killed with every racially profiled pull over. You can thank the misinterpretati
on of the second amendment and the NRA for that."
2.0,Time to end qualified immunity.

2.0,Funny they never say it's too much when waging war.
2.0,Too much is when you decimate the American economy and send manufacturing jobs overseas only to create even worse pollution on the other side of the earth. Too much is when the government spends seniors SS money on programs to create more dependent voters. Too much is when govt overregulates businesses including child care facilities so much that they need a lawyer in house to navigate those laws/ regulations.
0.0,Bernie is not radical. He's just a honest to god democrat. The corporate lobbies just hate the truth. What made america great was a strong middle class not a handful of billionaires. Reasonable people need to vote. Not just the clowns.

Are you ready for a radical statement? I happen to think that Joe Manchin is right. Yeah, physical infrastructure is terribly important. But I happen to think that the needs of the human beings of our country ‚Äî working families, the children, the elderly, the poor ‚Äî are even more important, and we can and must do both.
Look, everybody in America ‚Äî whether you're Republican, Democrat or independent ‚Äî understands that, for the last many years, the very richest people in this country and the largest corporations have done phenomenally well, while the working class and the middle class of this country struggle, and we have got close to 600,000 people sleeping out on the streets.

Elderly people in America can't afford to put dentures into their mouth. They have no teeth in their mouth in some cases, can't afford hearing aids, can't afford eyeglasses. Working families cannot afford child care for their kids. Young people cannot afford to go to college.

And then on top of all of that, the scientific community is telling us that we're looking at a cataclysmic crisis in terms of climate. Oregon is burning. California is burning.

People are drowning in New York City. Detroit is flooding. Siberia has seen the largest fire on Earth. Drought is happening in places all over the world.

The United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel. This is a crisis we are living in.

So, what polling tells us is that working families all over this country understand that NOW is the time for Congress to address the long neglected problems facing working families. Now is the time to have the wealthy and large corporations -- we've got billionaires in this country who don't pay a nickel in federal income tax.
So, I think we can do all of this. We can do the physical infrastructure.
We can do the reconciliation bill, create millions of good jobs, and finally tell the American people that we are going to stand up for working families ‚Äî not just the rich and the powerful. Let's get it done.

Reminder: The actual cost of the Build Back Better Act is not $3.5 trillion, it's $0. The funding working families need is going to be paid for by taxing the wealthiest and corporations."

2.0,"Bernie ur great, but u been saying the same stuff for years, & nothing been done.

So here's a NEW IDEA.
Can u & ur colleagues start referring to health insurance has a SOCIALIST CONCEPT, and belongs in a SOCIALIST MODEL.

Just saying it's a human right is fine, but that doesn't move the needle to much. U have to get ppl to see the logic, and change their minds. And u can do that better, by exposing the health insurance companies by doing the messaging this way.

How do health insurance companies make money?

They collect premiums r deny ppl coverage. THAT'S IT! And if u think about that, what is that, that's a SOCIALIST CONCEPT. If the CEO of XYZ insurance company is not happy making $5 million a year, they want to make 50 millon a year, what do they have to do, r the only thing they can do, is raise PREMIUMS r DENY ppl coverage. THAT'S IT. That's a socialist CONCEPT & belongs in a socialist MODEL. If u put a SOCIALIST concept into a CAPITALIST model, it will butt heads. It will not be as efficient r effective. And that's what we have now. And vice verse, u don't want a CAPITALIST concept in a SOCIALIST model. Otherwise, we'll all be waiting hours in line for stale bread. It's not like the CEO of walmart, if they want to make more money, they have to sell more, r be more efficient in their operations.Thus
, CAPITALIST CONCEPT, belongs in CAPITALIST MODEL. Same goes for health insurance companies. It's a SOCIALIST CONCEPT, & belongs in a SOCIALIST MODEL. Bcuz all they can do to make more money is raise premiums & deny ppl coverage. And that puts the squeeze on patients & doctors.

If u do the messaging this way, this will move the needle more to universal health insurance, bcuz ppl will see the truth & logic. Instead of just saying it's a human right, which it is, but to get more ppl to believe in universal health insurance, u need to do the messaging this way. A socialist CONCEPT belongs in a socialist MODEL. At minimum it should be non-profit.

I have some good ideas how to make to get this point across. And I'm sure, if u start this messaging, it will get done. Start beating the Republicans at their own game."

They'll make you poor,

You're a failure if you can't make ends meet
on impossible wages at an impossible cost of living
with a worthless degree you will never pay off no matter how hard you work
while advertisers blare at you about your insufficiencies

while the news man tells you war is normal,

while armed police guard grocery store dumpsters full of food from the hungry,
while executives go on five billion-dollar space rides for fun,

Take Oligarchizac‚Ñ¢ for your depression,

Side effects may include compliance,
acquiescence, subservience, docility,
menticidal ideation,
a marked lack of interest in guillotines,
a dystopian society and a dying biosphere.

They lock us in a room
and fill the room with water

an ability to buy food and think clearly,
a fondness for red flags,
and a hysterical corporate media.

And hey I think we just might make it,

0.0,"Yes, we need medical for all, apply 2% extra tax for medical below 65."
2.0,I agree this is a problem. But very few people use insulin in a vial these days. Let's talk about insulin pens and get up to speed. Or perhaps compare the average cost for 1 month's supply of insulin.
0.0,"Absolutely terrible the way we are charged for drugs. That should be number one for Congress, but hey, they don‚Äôt care about us and they have GREAT medical coverage. Maybe make them have what we do and have to actually pay for it and just maybe there will be a change. Seems like only Bernie is fighting for us. Keep it up Bernie maybe some day we will win."

2.0,"Absolutely. It‚Äôs K Street that‚Äôs responsible for this, and, of course, the politicians they bribe. We should make bribes to politicians illegal."

Anyway, the taxes are spent on health care among other things. Insulin is free, no cost for the patient at all.

Yes, I'm very aware you can't compare the US to Sweden. We're a small country with a different system. But if anyone is going to change the system, it's Bernie. He would be a kick-*ss president.

First, that sounds 100% like an administrative failure. Drug companies don't just get this research funding out of thin air. They negotiate with the government for them. Exactly like with the Covid vaccines. That deal has been outstanding for the American people. Could you imagine if everyone had to buy our vaccines out of pocket or through insurance? We probably wouldn't have 25% of Americans vaccinated, and they'd be coming from Europe.

I would laugh in the face of a drug co CEO if he came to me with a bullshit deal like what we have been getting. I would feel like he was spitting in my face. I would kick them out of the White House and call his biggest competitor asking if they would like to be the first drug company to release xyz drug? Yeah? Great, but if Americans are paying for the research we get royalties on sales which will go to help fund future medical research, and there will be cap limits on American patients, with lower caps for the elderly and veterans. We would get that drug developed and CEOs would seriously think twice about going to the White House thinking that they are going to scam the American people."

TooFarLeft
Education is a good investment from an individual, family, community or national perspective and tuition free education will reduce the burden from the root on our medical expenses too for example.

Healthcare for all is actually CHEAPER with the insurance industry off of the table along with most of the time lost due to billing among many other reasons.

A universal basic income (UBI) is CHEAPER than all of the thousands of individual federal, state and local social safety net programs including things like Social Security and unemployment insurance, etc with all of their budgets, overhead expenses and inefficiencies eliminating the humiliating need for people to lose time to prove their poverty to qualify for aid.

Internet for all is a great and necessary investment to give everyone the opportunity to study, search for work, work remotely, etc online.

Solar power is CHEAPER and electric vehicles are soon to be CHEAPER to make and already are considerably CHEAPER to maintain and operate, especially if charged from your own solar power.

What do you think will happen to crime rates, peace and equality in general after we launch universal healthcare, a universal basic income, universal education and internet for all, raising the starting point of capitalism from zero, we‚Äôll let you die with no money, to a level of life with dignity, reducing societal daily fears on a massive scale and freeing us to welcome the automation revolution with open arms rather than with fear and great harm? üòÉ EqualityMovemen

That all being said, you are highly full of üí© as usual not sharing free and substantially lower prices that your followers could receive (yes, WITHOUT insurance). I wonder how much innovation in medicine we‚Äôd have if we didn‚Äôt have incentives for companies to make new medical progress. I sure bet a socially managed drug world would stifle the advancement that these companies do and create. Focus on stopping your comrades in other countries and the white house from stealing from innovators and make them all pay their fair share. Why is there never any substance, background or solutions that exist that you can share? Greed my ass. Explain the dynamics and why what happens does. Hint: drug companies need to turn a profit and take on tremendous amounts of risk, failure, and loss. Protect American companies from getting robbed by socialist country extortion artists, defend intellectual property, and the prices will come down. You have such a presence and platform that could be used for good. All you do is fear monger instead of providing existing solutions and support for innovation.

I commend the Palm Springs City Council for going further than almost every other city, even the most progressive, in enacting both a vaccine and a mask mandate. Even San Francisco and New York have only mandated one or the other.

The city should now mandate medical grade masks, since cloth masks are virtually useless. In fact, they should unilaterally re-enact Newsom‚Äôs old color coded system, and require strict capacity limitations and masking outdoors. We need at least a 50% capacity restriction, plus a mask mandate, plus a vaccine mandate to control the virus now. And leave more restrictions options on the table if people just won‚Äôt behave.

‚ÄòReasonable people can disagree about when a zygote becomes a ""human life"" - that's a philosophical question. However, regardless of whether or not one believes a fetus is ethically equivalent to an adult, it doesn't obligate a mother to sacrifice her body autonomy for another, innocent or not.

Body autonomy is a critical component of the right to privacy protected by the Constitution, as decided in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), McFall v. Shimp (1978), and of course Roe v. Wade (1973). Consider a scenario where you are a perfect bone marrow match for a child with severe aplastic anemia; no other person on earth is a close enough match to save the child's life, and the child will certainly die without a bone marrow transplant from you. If you decided that you did not want to donate your marrow to save the child, for whatever reason, the state cannot demand the use of any part of your body for something to which you do not consent. It doesn't matter if the procedure required to complete the donation is trivial, or if the rationale for refusing is flimsy and arbitrary, or if the procedure is the only hope the child has to survive, or if the child is a genius or a saint or anything else - the decision to donate must be voluntary to be constitutional.
This right is even extended to a person's body after they die; if they did not voluntarily commit to donate their organs while alive, their organs cannot be harvested after death, regardless of how useless those organs are to the deceased or many lives they would save. That's the law.

Use of a woman's uterus to save a life is no different from use of her bone marrow to save a life - it must be offered voluntarily. By all means, profess your belief that providing one's uterus to save the child is morally just, and refusing is morally wrong. That is a defensible philosophical position, regardless of who agrees and who disagrees. But legally, it must be the woman's choice to carry out the pregnancy. She may choose to carry the baby to term. She may choose not to. Either decision could be made for all the right reasons, all the wrong reasons, or anything in between. But it must be her choice, and protecting the right of body autonomy means the law is on her side. Supporting that precedent is what being pro-choice means.‚Äô‚Äù ~ from a friend"

2.0,I was just talking about this. I don't watch Fox News anymore but this is exactly what I have been trying to say. Look at the tyrannical policies being enforced. It's coming to the US if people don't wake up. Read the studies and look at the science. Don't just take the word of mainstream media.

200 plus days of hard lockdown plus a similar amount under heavy restrictions such as not being allowed to have any visitors, work, travel more than 5kms,( 3 miles), and curfew from 9pm to 5am.
We are under the control of an insane dictator obsessed with eradication of the virus while nuking everything!
Kids and people are topping themselves or attempting to, and going around the bend.
Fine for going to the protest or disobeying rules is $5000 dollars!!
The mainstream media are pushing the same propaganda as the Andrews government has inflicted on us.
Lockdowns mightn't even end after we hit 80% vaccinated, now they're pushing for kids to be included!

So far 130 have passed away, and I would be confident to say 100 died of old age and the rest died of other illnesses other than Delta. They even listed a 15yr old boy as a Covid death who was in Hospital for menningacoccal.
It is absolute Tyranny in the state of NSW. We are not even allowed to protest, the Government has given the Police force all powers to make sure of that.

Sydney however has had an out break of Covid 19 D the state there is trying to get it under control, thus no large gatherings. The protesters were told not to go, as gatherings spread Covid. They went there with the intent to break the laws. We have been fortunate in Australia to avoid deaths from Covid and are proud to say only a few deaths not 1000s of deaths that followed uncontrolled riots like the US.

This bloke is contagious and refuses to quarantine or self isolate. So I have no problem with them locking him up in forced quarantine (comparison to FEMA camps etc is a bit silly, really. It is just 2 weeks isolation which many countries are enforcing, and if he cops a fine or jail term for breaking the law, so what). Yes our Govt is insane, but that's because, unlike most of the world, they are still aiming for ZERO COVID, which is rapidly slipping through their inept fingers. And high school kids were NOT forced to vaccinate without parents in a stadium - it was totally voluntary, and many opted to not vaccinate. There is enough crap going on in the world to expose, without hyping stuff up - it just diminishes your credibility. Disappointed, but still a big fan :)"

They will use this as evidence to push the party further right and it will help them fundraise in other states, the logic being that if democrats are even too crazy for California, then they‚Äôre clearly too crazy for states like Missouri or Ohio.

0.0,"In California, a recall election can be put into motion solely by getting a petition signed by a proportion of state citizens equal to or greater than 12% of the number of voters in the previous office election. As such, to force a recall election of Gavin Newsom--who won with 62% of the vote in 2018--only required 1.4 million signatures, or 3.5% of California's population. The recall is costing California $276 million and represents an attempted power grab by Republicans to take advantage of a non-regular election to unseat the democratically-elected governor.

According to the law, the recall is based on two questions: question one is a yes or no question about recalling Gavin Newsom, and question two is who would replace him were the yes vote to receive a plurality of the vote. So, technically, 3.5% of the population forces the other 96.5% to turn out in an irregular election to vote ""no"" by a plurality, or the most popular ""other"" candidate running (currently Republican Larry Elder with about 26% popularity) becomes governor. If a plurality votes ""yes,"" regardless of who they prefer, a candidate with less than 30% popularity can supplant the governor elected with over twice that popularity during a standard, regular election."

Only 65 signatures need to start the drive to recall and only 12% of the total votes counted in the last election needed for the recall to proceed. FWIW, Newsom beat his last opponent by 24%. However at 12.5 million votes cast, only 1.5 million needed for a recall to proceed. It gives the GOP a second bite at every election if they choose to take it. Seriously broken.  


I urge all California, left, right and center, not to sit this one out."

Every bill is backed by congressmen who take corporate money. I doubt AT&T is donating to ban abortion specifically, they are likely donating to many state and federal-level stooges hoping they will regulate their industry in AT&T's favor.

The Texas 'heartbeat ban' isn't medically accurate because there's no heart that early in pregnancy, providers say

Many women don't know they're pregnant at 6 weeks, when a pregnancy is still an embryo.¬†HUIZENG HU/ Getty Images

""Heartbeat bills"" are misnomers because there's no heart nor beating at 6 weeks of pregnancy.¬†

Doctors can only detect fluttering cells that will become the heart, and call it ""cardiac motion.""¬†

A 6-week pregnancy is an embryo, not a fetus, and fetal heart development is a continuum.¬†

The new¬†Texas law banning abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy,¬†like others like it, is often referred to as a ""heartbeat bill,"" indicating a cutoff point when doctors can detect a fetal heartbeat.¬†

As Texas Governor Greg Abbot¬†said in a Facebook video¬†right before signing the bill, it ""ensures that the life of every unborn child who has a heartbeat will be saved from the ravages of abortion."" The law is expected to be challenged and, if it prevails, will go into effect September 1, 2021.¬†

But¬†Dr. Bhavik Kumar, a family medicine physician and abortion provider at the Planned Parenthood Center for Choice in Houston, told Insider ""pregnancies this early do not have a beating heart"" ‚Äî and that's a medical fact.¬†

For one, a pregnancy that's six weeks along is still an embryo. It's not a fetus until the 9th week after conception or 11th week after the last menstrual period, according to¬†Healthline.¬†

Plus, most women don't even know they're pregnant at six weeks, let alone get a doctor's appointment to confirm it.¬†

""At six weeks, most women would not have any clue they were even pregnant if they weren't carefully tracking menstrual cycles, and that doesn't even take into account the millions of women with irregular cycles who might go six weeks or longer between periods as a normal part of their life,"" Dr. Stephanie Ros, an OB-GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of South Florida, told Insider.¬†

She said at that point, the embryo is a quarter-inch long. ""It's barely noticeable on ultrasound, we often have to use transvaginal ultrasound to be able to see it at all,"" she said.¬†

What's really happening is 'cardiac motion' from cells that will become the heart

The so-called ""heartbeat"" that's detected at six weeks isn't a heart nor is it beating. ""There's electrical activity within cells that will become a heart, and we see that on an ultrasound machine as a flickering that can be audible through the machine,"" Kumar said. ""We refer to that as cardiac motion.""¬†

""Certainly different people have different feelings around seeing that and what that means,"" Kumar added, ""and that is up to each person to decide how they value that.""¬†

Indeed, the president of the¬†American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which represents more than 60,000 OB-GYNs in the US,¬†made a similar point in 2019¬†in opposition to ""heartbeat bills.""

""Pregnancy and fetal development are a continuum,"" he said. ""What is interpreted as a heartbeat in these bills is actually electrically induced flickering of a portion of the fetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops."" That tissue continues to develop throughout the first trimester.¬†

Only in the past few decades has the technology been advanced enough to detect cardiac motion that early, Dr. Saima Aftab, medical director of the Fetal Care Center at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami,¬†told LiveScience in 2019. The fluttering, she said, also doesn't indicate the viability of the future heart or the pregnancy.¬†"

How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria?  How does that make it less of an economic burden to take an unwanted child and foist them into a poorly organized and definitely underfunded foster system (it's Texas, in case you think they care) that _mostly_ results in molestation, prostitution and abuse?  How does that not further the burden of guilt placed on someone who never wanted that child to begin with?

Utterly and completely destroying a good section of the work force, emotionally, physically, financially and in all ways permanently, (unless they have a neuralizer, panacea or a winning lottery ticket respectively) is not good for the economy.

And that's just considering the unlucky and unwilling mother.  What of her coworkers, or her significant other?  They have to pick up the hours or those companies simply do without, resulting in lost revenue, quality, and supply.  Have you ever worked a 12 hour double shift, or an 8 hour triple shift?  Because I fucking have, and I wasn't even involved.  Now you have to deal with burn out and turn over from an entirely unrelated set of people, time into training and damaged product or shoddy services resulting in slow-down FOR 9 MONTHS.  And that's if they can come back at all!  The U.S. at large basically doesn't even have a support system for pregnant people if you compare it to other first world nations.

There is no ""what if we try x."". This is a bad law designed to make broken homes that a political base can scapegoat and slavewage 16 years down the line.  It is designed to be economically expensive because that's _the whole point._"
2.0,"Do you know how much an abortion at planned parent hood or some other abortion clinic is? Honest question I do not know. I found planned parent hood says it could be $0-$1,500. but I am not sure what other places charge, I know in a hospital it can be 5,000 or a bit more for vaginal birth or higher for C-section. How can any women really afford a abortion then or delivery period then? 

You talk about How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body? or the trauma of childbirth? How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria.  Have you seen the side effects of both a hormonal pill abortion or a medical abortion? For hormonal pill, it is not unusual for a women having to go to the hospital because the bleeding does not stop, but continues to get worse. Some women become sick and mentally damaged seeing that amount of blood and the cells of the baby after cleaning up that mess, During the surgical abortion where they stick a vacuum up there, it is not unusual for the doctor to cause damage to the uterus and other organs that actuary harm the chance of having another baby in the future, along with bleeding, and causing tears that might need to be surgically fixed. So you will have to go to the hospital for surgery. which case is all traumatic in my opinion. and more of an economic burden now they have more bills to pay. (not saying vaginal birth or C-section is better they all have their risk too)

to your other argument, why cant an employer higher a temp from an agency? There are temp agency that people do sign up with to find part time work, they usually work part time or full time during a short period of work, do you think those short term workers would like to have that job for a bit?"

2.0,"Brazilians are clowns...I know it  ran away from the country as soon as I could. The truth however is more complex and it is not fully portrayed around the world. There are things, a few of them where Bolsonaro is right and on point, others show how ill-suited he is. With that being said, the options were even worse in the last elections.
The Supreme Court in brazil is the biggest joke there ever was, it needs to be completely reformed (The US supreme court should also be reformed, by the way)
The brazilians have a supreme court where ANY lawyer, appointed by a POLITICIAN can become a member, no need to be a judge, no need to be someone suited for the job, and that is a lifetime position! ANY supreme court that is unbiased and trustworthy need to be populated by FEDERAL JUDGES, appointe by election amongst all federal judges in the country, and I said JUDGES, not mere, ill-prepared lawyers. The political appointment process needs to be eliminated, and until it is so, no one will trust the courts. (that holds true in Brazil, US or any democracy).
Also, the voting issue, Bolsonaro is for electronic PLUS paper ballot, so it could be audited, similarly to the US...imagine an election where the electronic votes could not be audited? Yes, that is Brazil. But guess, the brazilian (comunists-inclined) opposition is against that. There is no transparency throughout society, and a society that has its powers opaque to its population, is a democracy of the rich and powerful, (like Russia, Belarus, China....and the list goes on) and all of these countries, including Brazil and US are heading that way unless structural changes are made....and those are usually painful. Inhave little hope though."
0.0,"You are saying shit. Bolsonaro supporters want a coup to keep Bolsonaro in the power as a dictator, it is what they truly dream of. 

Bolsonaro fighting corruption? Haha You must idolatrate  him to say this nonsense. 
Even the Lava-jato operation that has put Lula in jail he fought against. Now, we  know that his whole family is involved  crimes of stealing money of their employees in the government. He also protected the guy that as asking bribes when buying vaccine."
0.0,"I agree, there are a lot of reasons why Bolsonaro got there in the first place. I even voted for Bolsonaro in 2018, but because I was disillusioned with the polarized reality of that time and thought he represented a drastic change and action, but as it turns out he was another right-wing populist nutjob, and I slowly began realizing it just like many americans did with Trump. You rightfully point out the Supreme Court is politically appointed, but guess who appointed a judge who freed Lula from jail? You rightfully point out corruption is rampant, but guess who is the one who destroyed the Car-Wash Operation? Yes, Bolsonaro, because turns out, he is a corrupt crook along with his entire family. In the beginning, I used to believe that ""Bolsonaro is a fascist who wants to be dictator"" was just leftist conspiracy, but the more he began actually voicing against democratic institutions, the more I realized all these speeches about ""cleaning the swamp"", or about ""saving the nation"", or about ""the corrupts within congress"" have always been far-right dogwhistles and I had fallen this conspiracy rabbithole, which I have slowly been escaping ever since the pandemic began.

So no, there's no such a thing as ""communist-inclined"" opposition against Bolsonaro, because a lot of prominent right-wing political movements such as the MBL broke off with Bolsonaro, so his opposition is pretty broad even though there are indeed left-wing people in the opposition, just like every opposition against a far-right government. No, there is no such a thing as ""Bolsonaro is for electronic plus paper ballot"", because even if he was for that, the true intention of his when voicing for this agenda is to make people distrust the system and de-stabilize democracy so he can come out as ""the man who will solve it all"", and this entire agenda of electronic plus paper ballot is another dogwhistle for ""the democratic system is bad and I want to be dictator"". Yes, there is no transparency throught society and yes Brazil is a banana republic, but the ""twist"" is that Bolsonaro himself is part of the infamous ""Centr√£o"" of brazilian politics, you know, the ""banana politicians"" themselves, of the rich and powerful?

To summarize: the only thing Bolsonaro ever did for Brazil is to pave the path for the gangsters of Lula to come back and continue their legacy of corruption in the name of the poor, he destroyed the legacy of the sane right-wing who only wanted to fight the corruption of Lula and the PT, and most importantly: the deaths of thousands who fell into his far-right rethoric that the ""virus doesn't exist"", or ""if it exists, China made it up"", just like what happened to many americans with Trump. So fuck Bolsonaro, fuck his far-right nutjobs and fuck his terroristic ""milicias""."

2.0,"Yes, but the FACE Act, in its wording, protects both women and facilities."
0.0,"The thing is, if ""pro-life"" conservatives truly wanted fewer abortions, they would 100% support better sex education in schools and easier (or free) access to contraceptives, because those are the only two reliable methods of reducing the number of abortions. 

They go on and on about ""saving the life of the child"", but what about the quality of life for that child? Are Texas voters going to improve their foster care system? Will they support giving financial aid to mothers who can't afford the children that they never wanted? I don't hear any mention from them about what they are willing to do to support these unwanted children. 

Why are they silent about helping these unwanted children? Because they don't really care about the children. They only care about punishing women for being sexually active. They want women to suffer because those women aren't conforming to their conservative ideals."
0.0,"Pro-Life Religious Conservatives also love advocating for people who are on life support but will otherwise not get better. People who cannot advocate for themselves e.g. the braindead or the unborn are a great campaigning point for the conservative right because it requires no resources and allows them to both scare people and make people angry at the perceived moral backwardness of progressives.

0.0,Yeah no wonder rightoids chose the heart over the brain when deciding what‚Äôs alive

0.0,"In all fairness, while a fetus doesn‚Äôt yet a conscious, they are still likely to be born (unless there‚Äôs a as opposed to a brain dead person

Regardless, before the fetus is viable, it has no brain function and is on the same level as a brain dead person. The heartbeat argument isn‚Äôt a good one."
0.0,"Republicans once tried to steal a brain-dead woman from her family to keep her alive as a way of responding to exactly this argument.    
"
2.0,Is it illegal in Texas to put the fetus on life support and then pull the plug?
0.0,"Well, I think some Republicans are smart enough to realize that if they outlaw pulling life support on people who are brain dead, hospitals would be overwhelmed with care for individuals who had no chance of walking out the door again.

But Republicans have no problem telling women they need to be life support for a fetus, whether the woman chooses to or not."
0.0,The same people yammering on about abortion being murder believe that pulling the plug on a brain dead person is also murder. Remember Terry Schivo?
2.0,These monsters oppose that too. No matter how much their grandma is suffering they will refuse to end her misery.
0.0,"There is no logic when dealing with people willing to do mental gymnastics to fit their square beliefs into the round holes of reality. Let‚Äôs not get into the argument of let‚Äôs force motherhood on girls but not force fatherhood on boys. Or here‚Äôs a good one that‚Äôll put them in a logic loop, if an illegal immigrant is pregnant does that mean her child is a us citizen?"
2.0,"This is a messy analogy. Obviously a fetus at six weeks is ‚Äúalive‚Äù both sides know this. A brain dead person is at the end of their conscious and a fetus is at the beginning. That‚Äôs the real difference.

I don‚Äôt think republicans chose the heartbeat detection because that means human life. They think it‚Äôs human life from the start. They just know they have to keep it legal in SOME capacity, no matter how minor. The heart best is a symbolic choice for them. And it just so happens to be before most women even know that they are pregnant."
2.0,"Thinking back to Terri Shiavo, I'm pretty sure conservatives were arguing not to unplug her."
0.0,i‚Äôm all for abortion but how is someone about to die and someone ab to be born comparable
1.0,Interesting argument but the difference is that braindead people will never be cognitive again whereas fetuses are still growing into cognitive people

Women must be free to choose, not just for their own sakes, but for the sake of their children."
0.0,"This is of course correct. They don‚Äôt want abortions to go down, they want women to stop having sex (except with them of course). It isn‚Äôt about abortion, it‚Äôs about sex and who they think should and shouldn‚Äôt be having it."
0.0,"Its 100% about judgment and control. If you allow free access to contraceptives and sex ed, you are condoning sinners. To them, its a sin trade- sex or abortion."
0.0,I‚Äôve long held that any pro lifer that has their own kids instead of adopting is a hypocrite.
2.0,They should be pulling the plug on a lot of the COVID patients in ICUs. What a delusional waste.
1.0,I mean an abortion is just pulling the plug as well. The plug in this case is a womb.
0.0,"Everything that the religious right supports makes sense in the context of punishing women for sex and does not make sense in the context of preventing abortions: abstinence only education, prohibitions on birth control and lack of government support for families. At some point in time we have to stop giving abusers the benefit of their word."
1.0,Yes but the definition of ‚Äúlife‚Äù and ‚Äúalive‚Äù can be debated based on what you believe. According to science everything is alive in some way as long as the cells are alive
0.0,That was one very public case. Brain dead people get taken off life support every day and not a peep from the right. They also have no issue with taking a human life if they feel the human doesn‚Äôt deserve to live(executions).
0.0,"There is no difference. 

Either you support life, or you don‚Äôt. 

The republicans do not. 

You cannot claim to be pro life and be in favor of the death penalty.

You cannot claim to be pro life and be in favor of someone who refuses to wear a mask, knowing doing so may kill a child."
0.0,That‚Äôs horrific and sad. So many tragic stories that get conveniently ignored by people who call themselves religious. I am so GD tired of these people ruining the entire world for everyone else. So tired and so angry that I hope they do not get vaccines and get to meet their sky daddy sooner than later. The preverbal silver lining.

2.0,The type of people who shouldn‚Äôt be raising children include people who hide behind a screen and throw needless insults at strangers. I‚Äôm sure whatever little spawn comes from you will also be an asshole.
2.0,I agree that some of these people just don‚Äôt want what they perceive as an easy out for irresponsable sexual behaviors. Yes But a lot of these people very genuinely believe it‚Äôs wrong to end a human life in the womb. And not everyone who believes that is religious or even conservative.

0.0,"Why should it matter? It is an embryo not a baby. It is a woman's choice, nit the court's or government's while still not viable outside her body. Forcing a woman to carry is inhumane. Back to illegal, unsafe abortions?"
0.0,"""Noone has the right to use someone else's body or resources to continue existing""
The point is true in all aspects but it still extends way after a person is born, Infact, baby, children and even many teenagers may not be equipped to survive. In so the argument you provide also excuses a parent putting their infant baby on the street and leave."
2.0,"No. I mean, I think that‚Äôs a weak analogy. But yes, I agree abortion should be legal.

Abortion is killing a human. But sometimes it‚Äôs legal to kill humans. War. Abortion, endings brain dead people."
2.0,The media is full of shit on both sides. I believe abortion should be legal. I also think it is infanticide. And Im a Democrat. All these things can be true at once.

It is quite an irony that the truest defenders of Western Civ are our ~~nefariously leftist~~ liberal-arts universities thought, by the right, to be such hotbeds of leftist indoctrination."

That‚Äôs not really a controversial label. And also, how can you say Trump was ‚Äúsiding‚Äù with the Taliban by making deals, but then when Biden misjudges the Taliban‚Äôs invasion, and is forced to make deals with those terrorists directly BECAUSE OF HIS OWN MISTAKE, the Taliban is just ‚Äúthe ones that have to be dealt with‚Äù.

0.0,"Quite right. I thought the tone was visible, but it wasn't, so I edited my post.

Of course, it's idiotic. Just ask Hawley or Cotton, those Harvard prettyboys."
2.0,"Um, not really. It's not like it's a Western Civ book club that has one guy who broke a window and now the WHOLE CLUB is unfairly branded as window-breakers. The point of the organization is to incite street fights and parade around in uniform. Often with police, invited or not. In this, they are little different than the English blackshirts.

That they make noises about Western Culture doesn't impress me any more than do the noises jihadists make about religion."
2.0,"I was asked a question (that has been deleted) about ""what civ"" I'm ""proud"" of. Interesting question!

I was raised steeped in Western culture. Grandparents in the German film industry, photographer dad, actress mom. They taught me (some) German and French. Went to international school. Studied physics and medieval studies in a college with a Great Books program. 

I can't think of a better way to spend an afternoon than at the Met or MOMA. 

Am I ""proud"" of Beethoven and Mozart? I had nothing to do with them. I enjoy them, I love them, I am deeply moved by them. But pride implies personal achievement. Just look it up: 

1. feeling deep pleasure or satisfaction as a result of one's own achievements, qualities, or possessions or those of someone with whom one is closely associated.
""a proud grandma of three boys""
2. having or showing a high or excessively high opinion of oneself or one's importance.
""a proud, arrogant man""

I am quite proud of a short play I wrote that got a good review in the NY Times. It brought me to LA where I met my wife who was a TV writer. (Our little joke is that we met through the NY Times.)

I am proud of my father's work, with which I had little to do, but I helped him in the darkroom and changed his film sometimes. 

I work in the space program and I'm proud of that, though I'm in a support position and have nothing to do with designing or selecting missions.

But to be ""proud"" of Monet or Voltaire just seems bizarre to me. I love them and would defend them, and I'm deeply moved by them, and would be devastated if the works were destroyed. But pride doesn't enter into it."

0.0,"The last time republicans took over the senate, McConnell eliminated the filibuster. That‚Äôs how they confirmed all those federal judges and SCOTUS conservative judges. So yeah, Manchin and Sinema are pretty naive to believe if republicans win the senate, the filibuster will still be around."
1.0,"Lol, yeah. The GOP has really shown a pattern of following the rules in the past. 

This shit right here is why the Dems, who represent like 60% of the country's population, can't get anything done. When the GOP get power, they fucking use it. When the Dems gets power, they waste 18 months trying to be polite and bipartisan, then get fucking crushed in the midterms.

Voting rights, reproductive rights, climate efforts, income inequality reduction, and every other democratic effort is going to fail in the name of tradition and decorum."
0.0,It‚Äôs fun how you think McConnell isn‚Äôt going to eliminate the filibuster at the first available opportunity the moment they take control in 2022.

2.0,"Biden‚Äôs era of good governance is way behind us. His years in the senate are very different from what we‚Äôre seeing today. During Trump tenure, we‚Äôve seen a complete erosion of moderates and bipartisanship in congress. The guy is like a high school kid asking for his BFF to fight on his side. Biden can‚Äôt get his agenda passed, unless either Manchin and Sinema stop annoying us with their ‚Äúfilibuster is democracy‚Äù non sense, or republicans won‚Äôt use it to sabotage the democratic agenda."
0.0,"That‚Äôs what concerns you? 

What concerns me is McConnell absolutely eliminating the filibuster just to punish Dems for talking about doing so, and everyone being all ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt do that‚Äù as he proceeds to do it, followed by ‚Äúwell nothing we can do I guess.‚Äù"
0.0,"If you don't get rid of the filibuster then the GOP wins the midterm elections.

Then they get rid of the filibuster.

Then they take away your right to vote"

0.0,"Go for it then, and end the filibuster, and then come on here crying because the GOP got a majority and used your rule against you. They didn't write the nuclear option, we did, now you crying cause they used it. They didn't break any rule, they used the rule we wrote."
1.0,"It's fun how he used a Democrat rule to do it last time, and people like you can't understand how every new rule you put in place can and will be used against you. It feels good for the moment though, right. How's watching everything you accomplish with that rule get torn down in 2022 gonna feel."
2.0,"It. Is. Not. Just. Manchin. And. Sinema. 

I‚Äôd be willing to wager there are around 8-10 Democrats who would vote to protect the filibuster if it came down to it on the floor."
2.0,"My biggest fear about Biden, once I realized he was the only one who could win against trump, was that he knew how serious this moment was, but wouldn‚Äôt step up to it. 

My fears are being proven true every single day."
2.0,"They could‚Äôve gotten rid of the filibuster when they had slight control‚Ä¶but didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶.why?

Because they knew that getting rid of it would mean that every time the power structure changed, previous legislation could be undone with a simple majority."
2.0,"Sure, but you don‚Äôt use the nuclear option when convenient, for the simple fact, it overrules the filibuster."
1.0,"
Why were the democrats forced to go nuclear? You know why. Cut the ‚Äúit‚Äôs the democrats fault for going nuclear‚Äù crap. 

Would you rather they just shrug their shoulders and do nothing? 

‚ÄòCome on."
2.0,Well... they actually are the ones who ended filibusters for supreme court justices.
2.0,"I won't be complaining, but to be fair I've completely given up on this shit hole country. We've got like 2 actually liberal senators, 52 conservatives, and 46 who are very concerned on Twitter. I'm just hopeful I can emigrate before it gets much worse."

0.0,"Again, Biden grew up in a very different era of good government and don‚Äôt expect him to change. McCain was from his era and so ‚Äúwere‚Äù Lindsay, Collins and Murkowski. But since Trump came in, it hasn‚Äôt been the same on the republican side of the aisle. Not that Biden isn‚Äôt doing anything wrong at all. In fact, he‚Äôs on the right side of history. We‚Äôre simply faced with a different era of bad government led by conspiracy theorists in congress and state governments with ZERO knowledge of American government and history per se."

I was a lifelong Republican, until 2017.  The GOP of today does not resemble the GOP of 2015."
0.0,"So you mad about the Republicans using a procedural rule that Democrats came up with to do something you didn't like. And using that as justification to make an even more easily abused rule because it benefits you at the moment, with no concern for the Republican abuses that are almost guaranteed.  Talk about short sighted."
0.0,"Huh, I‚Äôm saying that the only thing the Bible says about abortion is a recipe for, quite literally, performing an abortion, commanded by God, in the tabernacle nonetheless. I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúthou shalt not kill‚Äù has to do with it. 

"
0.0,"We‚Äôre going to have to agree to disagree. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm 38, and my entire adult voting life has been watching bad government and watching the Republicans win, even when Democrats have power. 

Trump isn‚Äôt the beginning of something, he‚Äôs the culmination of decades of bad government on Republican terms. He‚Äôs the inevitable endgame of the Republican Party. 

If we can‚Äôt expect Biden to change, then we deserve to lose in 2022 and he deserves to be impeached by the Republicans in 2023. 

Historians in free countries‚Äî which won‚Äôt be ours‚Äî will look back and consider this all to be a progression, not a sudden shift from good government to bad government with the election of Trump.

The election of Trump was the natural reaction to America daring to elect a black man, and you‚Äôd better believe Republicans will burn the country to the ground before they ever see Kamala Harris in the Oval Office. 

We our on borrowed time, a narrow window, and Biden is counting on institutions to save us when they have already failed."
0.0,"You‚Äôre looking at the whole thing from your own simplistic point of view. You do know republicans became the party of ‚ÄúNO‚Äù under Obama right? They wouldn‚Äôt allow democrats to pass any bills at all. Please don‚Äôt make this about me. Unless you understand that republicans spend their entire terms in congress sabotaging democrats, this conversation is futile. Many republicans came by and went, but Gingrich, Boehner, McConnell and McCarthy have been the worst in modern history. Democrats legislate, republicans on the other hand, spend their entire time resisting democratic legislations without offering any alternatives. Pro-life and white supremacy aren‚Äôt what make the nation move forward. When was the last time republicans introduced any bills for the general welfare? Tax cuts for the wealthy?"
1.0,"I‚Äôm 100% sure the person living in the fantasy world is you, who for some reason thinks the filibuster is part of the Constitution and will save Dem progress. 

Bless your angry heart."
1.0,"Anyways, let‚Äôs come back to this conversation in about two and a half years when McConnell ends the filibuster and you act surprised about it. 

It‚Äôll be right around the time they‚Äôre impeaching Biden, just because they can.

Can‚Äôt wait to say I told you so. 

But, sure. The filibuster, man. Totally the savior of American democracy."
0.0,"Yeah, Moses‚Äô Book of Numbers. I thought you were against abortion and my only point was that republicans keep throwing their anti-abortion stances out there and it‚Äôs apparently based on Christianity, yet they‚Äôre unable to prove which scriptures in the Bible ban it."
0.0,"This passage from Numbers is always mentioned and always dismissed. Most pro-life people will interpret this as a recipe for causing sterility, not abortion. Either way, pretty disturbing."
0.0,"In modern history and right after Gingrich, the only time republicans were this extreme was when Obama came in. No one is saying there was never any disagreements between democrats and republicans, it‚Äôs expected and as a matter of fact, it‚Äôs part of the democratic process in which the system of checks and balances is based on and compromise being the ultimate outcome. And yes, Trump did finalize the radicalism of the Republican Party that went directly after the very institutions of the federal government. That‚Äôs not disagreements, it‚Äôs anarchy, sedition and treason. I‚Äôm fully aware of the racist, anti-semitic, homophobic, Islamophobic and sexist agenda of the Republican Party to attend to its confederate base, but it didn‚Äôt amount to an insurrection on the Capitol until Trump came in."
1.0,"Yea, like 4 years under Trump being the no party. Grow the fuck up and try and understand that you can't do anything that they can't do. Make a new rule, they will show you how to use it. But by all means do what feels good for the moment. Who cares if they use it to pass a national abortion ban in 3 years."
2.0,"‚ÄúThe only time Republicans were this extreme is when Obama came in.‚Äù 

Sigh. 

You‚Äôre very close to getting it."
0.0,"‚ÄúMake a new rule, they will show you how to use it.‚Äù 

Guess the Democrats should just continue to play chess with rules according to how Republicans want them as the pigeons shit all over the chess board, then."
0.0,"You jumped to Obama without paying attention to my comments on Gingrich first. I can go all the back to the very beginning with the founders. Do you want to start to Thomas Jefferson? Because I‚Äôm pretty sure, the crisis we‚Äôre dealing with as of now is due to DJT and his Russian backed QAnon. BTW, I know what the fake Tea Party did. This thread simply isn‚Äôt dealing with that topic. Trump launched a failed coup d‚Äô√©tat, that‚Äôs an attack on the entire United States government."
2.0,"Continue to follow the fucking constitution, and rules that have stood for a hundred years. Make some new ones, and you better believe they are going to show you how to use them."
0.0,"And you‚Äôre, for some reason, just forgetting about that whole era when Republicans embraced McCarthyism, or maybe that‚Äôs just good government.

Or when the Republican Party embraced the southern strategy. 

Or when the Republican Party essentially stole the 2000 election. 


Again, the crisis we‚Äôre dealing with now did not start with Trump. 

The insurrection on the Capitol was the inevitable conclusion. 

McCain gave us Sarah Palin. 

Murkowski and Collins and Romney aren‚Äôt the good guys that are going to help us save democracy. 

There are no moderate Republicans, and haven‚Äôt been any moderate Republicans in a long time. 

We‚Äôve had multiple opportunities to stop this crisis from unfolding, it‚Äôs just the Democratic Party, in spite of all evidence to the contrary, continued to at least pretend to believe the GOP was operating in good faith, until the insurrection happened. 

Anyways, I think we‚Äôre both basically in agreement and on the same side. 

I just think our crisis began well before Trump and the insurrection happened."
0.0,"It‚Äôs fun how you think the Republicans are gonna give a damn about the Constitution when they take back control in 2022.

Anyway, the filibuster wasn‚Äôt originally part of the constitution."
0.0,"Democrats need to finally learn from the GOP. Judges, nobody gets approved during an election year unless it's Dem appointed PERIOD, NO EXEPTIONS EVER. With the abortion law in Texas, Dems, listen to me, USE THIS PRECIDENCE TO GO AFTER GUNS. In the Dem states, outlaw all firearms and use the people to enforce it. That's the key, if the State isn't enforcing the law, the law can't be challenged, law stands. Come on Dems, I know it's not in your passive nature, but let's get tough, it's time. ""But we don't want to stoop to their level"", grow up and start winning for once"

So what else you got?"

0.0,"By putting our ally Chad, on the no fly list, trumpy caused the death of these four soldiers. When trumpy did this, Chad immediately pulled their soldiers out if the area.

He caused their deaths.   

The even worse hypocrisy was their absolute radio silence on this--Trump literally CAUSING the needless deaths of four American soldiers--after years and years and years of screaming about Benghazi (which was an attack on the US Embassy in a known hotspot, the same as other attacks during the Bush and Reagan presidencies--AND Hillary had requested add'l security, and the GOP had refused it)."

2.0,"You can interpret it that way if you want but I don't understand it that way. The title calls out the Republican hypocrisy for blasting Biden now while being fine with Trump back in 2017.

By that standard calling out the different reactions to similar situations aka hypocrisy is from now on always ""whataboutism"" and we will no longer be able to call out hypocrisy at all.

Also what is blasted here is neither the situation leading up to the events nor the failures that led to them but rather the reaction to them."

I've experienced political shithousry in other countries but it's on another level in the US, ~~politicians~~ actually more the supporters, of both sides do the same thing when their guy is not in power. They also do the same thing when your guy is in power. When trump was in t_d was all about obama and drone strikes and now all the dem subs are *but trump did worse*."
1.0,"So what exactly would you call a ‚Äúwhataboutism‚Äù then? It is bringing up a perceived misdeed, of the past, from the opposition, to deflect from the criticism of a current situation.

(Sure he might‚Äôve said ‚Äúgrab ‚Äòem by the pussy‚Äù but that was just locker room talk. Clinton actually sexually harassed his underlings) Doesn‚Äôt that sound familiar?"
0.0,"Dunno in which reality you live but while there are certainly die hard democrats who see no fault in what Biden does the amount of worship Trump gets from republicans is on a whole different level.

There is literally a hearing about the Afghanistan withdrawal initiated by democrats about the Afghanistan withdrawal.

Trump instigated a mob to storm the capitol and got much less heat from republicans than Biden now gets from democrats.

 just as an example.

So no. It is not even close on both sides and thinking that both sides do the exact same thing is again either misinformed or just plain dishonest."

I only disagree that this is the intention of this post. The intention is as I read it to make people remember how different republicans REACTED to the things Trump did wrong compared to how they react to Bidens mistakes now.

The huge difference to me is that the title attacks republicans for their hypocrisy and does not focus on whether Trump or Bidens mistakes were worse."

Being trans is fine if that's how a free individual wants to live.  I literally don't care.  However, it is completely false to claim that men can get pregnant.

The problem was, the sharpies were bleeding through the front-and-back ballots leaving numerous ""extra"" sharpie circles.  Several of us demanded new ballots that we would fill in with regular pens but were told NO, we had to do it their way.  There's no way that any ballot reader machine was getting the correct reading on those ballots.

So they're going to get at least 45-50% of the vote no matter who is running."

2.0,"I guess that I am by definition a RINO given that I do vote Republican but only because they represent more of my positions than Democrats.  I'm pretty centrist politically speaking.  So, please pardon me if I'm not one of the folks this sub is supposed to be for.  But I just feel it necessary to point out how intellectually bizarre the rhetoric against Ivermectin is.

Now, I'm not an anti-vax guy.  I've had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and have no problem getting a booster if it's necessary.  I was also one of the first people in my state to get COVID in March of last year.  But I respect everybody's choice about what to do with their own bodies.  I'm not taking a position against anyone's rights or decisions.  The point I'm making is solely to reveal what I believe to be an intellectual weakness in the anti-Ivermectin crowd's arguments.

The anti-Ivermectin crowd rails against it because it's ""not meant for humans"" and other similar arguments.  However, Ivermectin is FDA-approved for human use.  And do you know what is **not** FDA-approved?  **The vaccine.**  

So, here you have these people insulting your intelligence over the fact that some folks are taking a drug originally not meant for humans but that eventually became FDA-approved for human use and recognized as having legitimate, beneficial uses in humans.  But those same people are out there pushing crazy ideas like vaccine mandates and prison time if you don't get a substance shot into your arm that is **not** FDA-approved.  

I'm not usually one to just lay into somebody and call them dumb, but in this case, I think it's safe to say that many of these anti-Ivermectin people are, in fact, dumb.  At the very least, they fail to see the intellectual inconsistencies in their positions.  One can only assume that if those same people were diagnosed with a blood clotting disorder that they would refuse to allow a doctor to prescribe them Warfarin.  You know, since Warfarin is rat poison."

They gain power, maybe for selfish or selfless reasoning but it always ends up with them stuffing their pockets. 

How else you think things dimwitted democrats have such money? Pelosi is worth over $100m. She didn't get that by GIVING like they all say they want us to do. Big pharma and many, many other corporations pay them off. They talk about being Sweden or Switzerland but that'll never happen when you run a poorly managed buisness where more money leaves what its ment for to go to pockets of assholery.

Look to the top 1% for funds. In return, bills and laws are passed that are more in line with corporations than in line with we the people. Our donations are petty and not enough for them. 

Our founding fathers warned us of a two party system. Its destroying our country.  Last time this country came together was/2001. There was no hate against race, religion and sex within America against  each other. that didn't matter. Now we cant even come together for a virus thats making millions of people sick making 10s of thousands of people die.

They still pushed experimental substances that were not FDA-approved to be forced on people while using disgusting rhetoric against people who tried other experimental treatments.  It was always an intellectually dishonest position."

2.0,"I honestly don't think it is going to have much of an impact. I deal with hiring in Florida where the extra benefits were gone over 2 months ago, and it has only gotten more scarce. Way more scarce if I am honest.

I would assume it extends variably to the rest of the country, but only speaking for my area, the major problem seems to be key industries not recovering fully hold back others. The biggest one I hear from prospects  is childcare. Many childcare facilities that existed pre-covid don't exist now. And the ones that do charge significantly more than they did before, because supply is low and demand is high, so they can easily. Everyone knows childcare is expensive, but when it goes up 30 or 50 or 100% or more over a year, many of the people who were working just dont make sense anymore unless they get a raise or a different job, and thats IF you can find one that can and will take your money. Theres waiting lists everywhere for childcare.

There's been a return somewhat to having a stay at home mom or dad in many families because working where they worked before is now negative money. Our economy has been used to having more adults in the labor force, as opposed to a single household earner. A return to that in any significant percentage easily continues the trend we are in now.

Now it doesn‚Äôt have to be a college degree, for some high paying jobs it could be trade school, a software coding boot camp, a certification program, etc. But for this specific job, it was a specific college degree. I then decided to go to school to get this degree. It sucked, and between school and my job I was putting in 70-90 depending on the week. I had no life whatsoever for 4 years, and like I said, it sucked. But it was totally worth it. I now work in the industry that I had originally researched. 

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the pay for your current job, you need to get a higher paying job. In order to get a higher paying job, you need to acquire a skillset that people will be willing to pay you money for. Like I said above, this doesn‚Äôt have to be school, as school can be expensive. However, there are plenty of affordable ways to attend school, and I am perfectly happy to share these with you (or anyone else) if you care, and I would love to help. Regardless, trade schools and certification programs can also be great ways to increase your skillset.

> People want to be able to retire comfortably without having a $100k salary their whole life. People want to work to live, not live to work. 

You don‚Äôt need anywhere close to a salary for your whole life in order to retire comfortably. You can retire comfortably on far less (I guess it depends on what your definition of comfortable is). Again, if you (or anyone else) wants more information on how to do this, please let me know, or visit It‚Äôs really not difficult at all, and I‚Äôd love to help where I can.

I, too, have been skeptical about the financing method of UBI, and it's a semi absurd concept for me. Europe already has quite extensive basic income systems, but they are bound to conditions. A few countries have UBI test phases from time to time.
I think it's an interesting concept and am interested to see how it will work out.

I can somewhat relate to many if these topics, because i changed workplaces during lockdown for a job that sounded less prestigious on paper, but pay was significantly better, more time off, more benefits, less micromanagement, less pressure ""from above"". And that functions quite as well.

Everything essential for living could be provided to an individual but work would still absolutely be required. In fact it would no longer be optional at all. when services are provided for free what incentive is there to do it? I don't know how many people would work in a warehouse for free and the same goes for teachers, doctors, surgeons. These are absolutely essential positions that now need to be assigned rather than staffed voluntarily. You can't just not pay these people.

You can advocate for a higher wages thats fine, but removing or severely reducing salary *(Which would absolutely be necessary in a gov. controlled scenario)* has dire consequences. This is why the USSR had so many problems. Magnitogorsk is a prime example. So many people died in that industrial hell hole due to the sever lack of any real experience since they just assigned random people to work in the mines & foundries. I mean imagine being told to work as an ER tech with no option to leave or find another job else where.

No, its economic.  The amount Yang was talking about was $1000 per month, and Yang was talking about getting people off welfare by moving them to UBI.  Very few people can live off $12,000 per year, so they'd still need to have another source of income.  Nobody would voluntarily switch from welfare to UBI - they make far more on welfare - and if forced, they would riot.  So we're talking about UBI *in addition to* welfare.

> And with 2. has it been calculated before?

328 million people times $1000 per month is $4 trillion per year - which just happens to be about the same as our total Federal revenues.  It would leave nothing left to pay for the rest of government.  Even getting rid of welfare would just reduce the amount of programs you can't pay for.

2.0,And they supposably want to hand out another 2k to almost everyone. What good is giving away money if it's worthless because of the inevitable hyper uncrease in inflation.
1.0,"It's stealing from those of us with savings rather than debt, and those who are retired.  So as usual, punishing success and rewarding failure."
2.0,"How is this stealing from those with savings and the retired?? Seniors will be taken care of in this bill, and I understand the ultra wealthy will be a tax break.. these are good things right?"
2.0,"When the government spends this massive an amount of money, they are borrowing or conjuring up money in some way.  Those dollars now compete with our dollars in the market for the same goods.  Supply of money is up, demand for goods is up due to government spending, leading to of the dollars in people's savings and retirement funds.   Those in or near retirement are typically on fixed incomes or invested in less volatile, lower return assets such that they can't keep up with high inflation.  Those in the workforce and earlier in thier investing years are invested in riskier assets who's return is more likely keep up with inflation and in theory their wages rise with inflation (in theory...). In any case, every dollar you have is worth less, and every dollar you have borrowed and spent is also worth less.  Reducing your effective debt if you're in the red, but harming your savings if you are not.

The ultra wealthy primary have money in corporations whos assets and value are pretty well hedged against inflation.  It won't harm them, it'll mostly harm middle to upper-middle class."
1.0,"So, what is the avenue of change that limits our government from the u.s. dollar? Government spending and tax breaks for the ultra rich seems to be a problem that we have to deal with.  Spending money on needles wars that go to the military industrial complex seems to be a moot point in all this. How can we get rid of special interests stealing from normal folks? Do we not target corporate interests in how they do business in the U.S. and beyond? Shall we make folks like Bezos and Musk pay more taxes to offset this spiral?"
2.0,"If you took 200 billion from Bezos and just handed it out to all US citizens, it would be about $600 per person, one-time.  It wouldn't change anything drastically.  The scale of government spending is so far beyond the ultra wealthy it's obscene.  My point is the ultra wealthy are not the problem or the solution.  They're an inevitable result of a global economy in my view.  They aren't necessarily evil or good, but one thing that's pretty universal is that they have changed the world on a global scale.

The exception to the above being when special interests and lobbyists are pushing policy not in our best interest with billionaire dollars driving policy.  We used to call that corruption or at least a conflict of interest or ethics violation.

I have no idea how to fix it, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, so hold my beer:

1) Remove the power and money from DC by drastically decreasing federal spending and returning power to the states.  I'm thinking decentralization of this power makes it harder to corrupt and more accountable to the people.

2) Cryptocurrency may be a game changer.  I'm sure with its own set of unforseen consequences.


I don't know what the numbers are currently, but Biden was proposing something like 10 trillion in spending over the coming years.  For my household, of which, I'm the only income earner, if we naively just divide 10 trillion by 330 million citizens, then multiple by the number in my household, that's about 150,000 the government is spending of my earnings, on my behalf.  The reality is worse, because the bottom 50% aren't effectively paying federal income tax (though of course they pay other taxes).  I'm sorry, I have better things to spend on than supporting bloated, inefficient government.  That's only proposed new federal spending, I already pay property tax, sales tax, gas tax (presumably for 'infrastructure'), local income tax, state income tax, medicare, social security, and the corporate taxes, etc built into the good we buy.

All things considered, the bureaucrats are probably really close to controlling more of the wealth we produce than we are.  I am not against all taxes, but the way I see it the bureaucracy in DC is effectively a parasite which is bleeding us dry with debt and wasteful spending.  I don't know where all that money goes, but I'm certain obscene amounts are being wasted or even being spent on causes directly opposed to the interests of the citizens paying for this mess."

1.0,"Fauci was well aware that specific research into bat cornovirus was taking place at the Wuhan Virology Institute. He specifically approved funding of this type of research. Yet, early in the pandemic he pushed the line that the virus spontaneously popped up in a wet market in the same frigging city where they were studying this specific thing. 

He knew, he lied, and he may very well have been the cause of the entire massive catastrophe that COVID19 and will forever be.  It's not a stretch to make this claim. 

It is entirely possible that the man who was instrumental causing the deaths of over 4.5 million people and the loss of trillions of dollars in economic activity is in fact the same man that is being celebrated as a hero by people like Trevor Noah, John Oliver and others. In fact, there appears to be solid evidence to this.

1.0,"I want to push back in the idea that the Dems are outright hemorrhaging minorities.  I think it's important to qualify what's going on here with minorities starting to vote republican. 

Let's look at the 2020 election. The Trump campaign made significant investments in reaching specific minority communities eg. Tejanos in TX, American Indians in NC, and black men in general.

With the first two, the Trump campaign used messaging that spoke specifically  to those groups. Acknowledging their history, and issues specific to them. In contrast the Dems reached out to those groups as members of the ""BIPOC"" Community. The idea of BIPOC people as a group was created by the left and is defined by their ""shared oppression"". This allowed Trump to win groups which republicans never won.

Trump was able to blunt the Dem edge with black men both through his personal appeal and superior messaging. Saying, if I'm president the economy will be so good you can get rich. But again the Dems just lumped them under the BIPOC label and told them if you like trump you're not black.

In conclusion Trump was able to either blunt the Dem edge or win outright with specific minority groups by tailoring messaging for those groups and giving them an optimistic as opposed to a pessimistic message.  The takeaway is that Trump's approach is replicable and useful, but requires significant investments in crafting proper messaging and finding the right groups to target."
2.0,Biden recently put some visa restriction on people involved in the current genocide against the Tirgray and Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia. There's currently debate around a house resolution(H.R 445) to formally condemn Ethiopia and Eretria for genocide and crimes against humanity. Pompeo and Inhofe are lobbying on behalf of the Ethiopian and Eritrean government in opposition to Biden and most of congress.
1.0,"Great question. Sorry for not including information (this is something that is practically common knowledge in my circle - apologies)

See [

Also Twitter is a good metric as well [ 

Currently there is 0 coverage from MSM - in fact any coverage is anti-Ethiopia pro-interventionist (akin to Libya).

2.0,"The sad fact is that the narrative of ""Tigray Genocide""  has successfully reached the international audience, despite the facts on the ground.

* Cause of war was the Nov 4th attack by the TPLF (Tigray People's Liberation Front) - the ousted former ruling party of Ethiopia for over 30 years (BAD DUDES).
* Amharas have been ethnically cleansed from many areas  (Wollega, Mai Kadra, Chena, Agmasa, etc...)
* TPLF using Child Soldiers to continue their crusade in Afar & Amhara regions.

Yet TPLF has rebranded it's name (in name only) to TDF)and cries genocide while killing civilians of all ethnicities (Crocodile tears). 

In Ethiopia, there are 80+ ethnicities. Yet, TPLF (The Tigray Rebels) are literally the only faction which is actually using ethnicity as a target - yet you probably don't hear these narratives."

1.0,"I haven't came across this NPR article - thanks for correcting my hyperbole.

Most outlets that reaches our circle Amnesty International, CNN, NYTimes, BBC, & The Telegraph has reported one sided stories that coverup or sympathize with the TPLF (the aggressor) by appealing to their ethnic base despite them even targeting their own who disagree.

Let me just give you a glimpse to what I'm referring to:

* NYTimes + Senator Coons makeup stories to blame the Ethiopian PM as cause.
   * [
* The Telegraph jumping through hoops to blame Ethiopians of Genocide.
   * [

There is so so so much more - if you know an Ethiopian talk to them and they'll tell you. At the moment MSM isn't reporting the facts (at best cherry picking & downplaying). I'll be doing my best to TLDR the series of events - I'm just one dude trying to clear the misinformation.

Seriously talk to an Ethiopian. Ask them about news coverage. Ask them about the Democratic Party & Biden. If what I say is a lie you'll see it reflected in their words.

Promise I'll centralize all the info. Currently, misdeeds are lost in Tweets & Local News - this shit is much deeper than they tell you."
1.0,I have a coworker who‚Äôs not from Ethiopia but her parents are. The way she tells it is that it started out as basically a group wanting their own freedom and then the bigger government coming in and squashing the attempts. So the little guys started taking hostages and killing civilians Vietnam style and then big government started ethnic cleansing. Basically just sounds fucked up all around.
2.0,"Unfortunately, you'll hear 2 stories and it's mostly divided on ethnic lines and allegiance.

If they're from Tigray (most likely but not universal) will tell you that story you shared.

Ethiopia has 80+ Ethnicities, but one political group (from Tigray) is trying to make a comeback after being ousted from power - after 30 years of being the ruling party. The TPLF is not a small guy - it's literally a political group that has used Racism to divide Ethiopia.

TPLF's aim is to make itself look like the good guy using it's operatives across the world. They are a rich & extremely corrupt group that got the boot due to a popular uprising.

Democracy has emerged; and ethno nationalism (their bread & butter) is under threat.

Imagine having the US dividing states based on ethnic lines (like This is for Whites Only, This is for Blacks Only, etc...) That's who they are... racism is a political opinion in their mind :)

Here's a joke

* Republican talks about race... they're a racist
* TPLF kills, borders & imprisons based on race... they're a fledgling democracy

2.0,"Yes I agree, and I don't like it.

That being said, it's been far easier for me as a nuclear advocate to convince a right winger to support nuclear power than to have a left winger support nuclear.

The left bludgeoned the right with emotional appeal and NIMBYism to shut down our stance on nuclear in the general public, meaning that the only options left if you knew solar and wind wouldn't do anything would be to either be silent and keep voting... Or throw your hands in the air. It's so easy to bring right wing republicans who don't believe in climate change back to believing in reasonable stances on environmentalism as long as A) it's incremental and B) you validate their concerns. Same thing I've done with most topics.

And, to be honest, if the right says don't spend money and not solve the problem, and the left says spend more money on something that won't solve the problem... I think not spending money is still a better option.

It's so irritating if you look at it and see how the the nuclear regulatory commission called a lot of the anti nuclear attacks ""leftist trash"" all the way back in the 80s. If they let us keep going we would have been like France and this wouldn't have been an issue."
2.0,"As a hard left winger, yeah yeah I know, not supposed to post, I actually agree with your stance on nuclear and also support nuclear power. I really think the energy generation stuff is a problem on both sides... with dumb republicans talking about bringing back coal as a major energy source, and dumb people on my side shutting down ideas like nuclear as efficient ways of generating clean energy.

The problem with don't spend money and don't solve the problem is no steps are being made towards solving the problem. Not saying spending money is great, but it can at least create progress to a solution if well managed.

Now whether you think the left can manage it well is of course a valid concern... I also believe government is wasteful and stupid in many situations after all."
2.0,"To be fair, I‚Äôm somewhat left leaning and super into nuclear.  It‚Äôs not a lost cause.  I actually find a lot of the older more conservative men who don‚Äôt know much about nuclear are the ones still quite nervous about it!"
2.0,"Hey man, in this polarized time I'm happy to find common ground. One of my best friends since I moved to GA is a traditional auth left guy, and when we have to talk politics that's our common ground we loop back to.

It is true both sides have their derps, we just need to reel them in. I remember being 'shut down' by someone on the left calling me a climate change denier because I said renewables can't fill our energy needs.

And I get that nothing is being done if you do nothing... But sometimes if you're given two shitty options I'd rather we do the least shitty one. 

As an example, let's say we told two people to each pick up a cinder block and carry it 100m east. If one person is fiddling with the block and then walking 30m south, and the other is kind of sitting there... That would mean the person sitting there is putting us in a better position.  That's how I view it; if we spend ungodly sums of money in renewable tech that won't solve the problem were essentially wasting money. Don't get me wrong, I think the gov should be, in general, supporting tech advancements... But we need to prioritize. If we took half the renewable funds and gave it to the scientists and engineers trying to make  nuclear stations cheaper or faster to construct, it would have actually made a dent.

Cheers to finding common ground, from a right winger to a left winger!"

2.0,"Yep, you guys just also have to work on your older conservative ally‚Äôs that really only have poor knowledge of the (mostly man made) disasters of the past.  People like me will work the left. 
Most libs I know are in favour of a *diverse* energy economy.  More wind, yes. More solar, yes. Nuclear additions, yes. nationally refined oil products, yes.  Not everyone left wing is ultra progressive, just like not everyone right wing is alt-right extreme. There‚Äôs a middle ground somewhere with a lot of overlap on these issues."
2.0,"In the documentaries I‚Äôve watched, the ‚Äòmajor‚Äô accidents have been due to negligence.   I‚Äôm definitely open to links citing otherwise, however, it‚Äôs my understanding that Chernobyl for example was a direct result of plant management ignoring power source protocols and straight up causing an avoidable disaster (trying to cover it up obviously didn‚Äôt help) and 3 mile island for another example, was the result of a leak that was not registered by any sort of sensor or properly maintained and was an entirely avoidable incident in itself as well.  Sadly, communication technology wasn‚Äôt at the level it has been at for the last couple decades to lead to faster, more experienced troubleshooting either.  Both examples are tragic and damaging to the psyche, but, when studied, the argument of how dangerous they are lessens as the argument for human error grows."
2.0,"Exactly. I was literally just watching a Chernobyl technical documentary last night and it explained what happened and why. The engineers allowed the nuclear reactor to enter an unstable state without realizing what had happened, and then had pulled too many control rods out causing the reactor to overheat and explode"

1.0,"A key aspect to a happy world is harmony. Harmony consists everybody. Harmony is influential. Happiness is influential. Those two things don't exist in the overall human race because of a lot of set backs. One key thing that divides the human race is the difference in ethics. Good ethics or morals are principles that contribute to Good conduct and good conduct is a positive influence that contribute to harmony. Good ethics should be universal around the earth just like a smile generally means happiness around earth.

Here's the thing. Besides all the crime and misery that contribute to this sick world that has it's negative influence, you also have loose morals (let's say loose conduct for better understanding) and loose conduct has it's negative influence. Example, parents that regularly curse around their kids might influence their kids even if they tell them not to do it. Homosexuality, is, loose, conduct. It has it's influence as you can clearly see around you in today's world. It, contributes, negatively, to, humanity. How?

Homosexuality challenges the importance of ethics, logic and reasoning. Three common things you need for wisdom and Three common things that are challenged in committing crimes like murder, domestic violence, rape etc.. When you challenge those things in regards to the ethics of sexuality, it attacks the meaning of ethics in general and attacks the human cognition like, 'if I could do this I could do even more' which could lead to recklessness. It also attacks the meaning on quality of life, like how a person experiences life. Influence effects your motivations and your mental and physical wellbeing, and it's contagious because it effects you and everyone else.

So how is homosexuality truly beneficial to those doing it and to humanity? The world is like a family household, if one thing is out of place, everything is. So we all have a part on contributing to earth and humanity, it's best to be in harmony not disarray. But this world won't be in harmony with loose conduct, that's one key reason why the world is the way it is today.

Some might say that we sent our former family members into battle with the best technology and resources available and they would be partly right. ¬†But our true strength has always resided in our steadfast faith in God. ¬†Our belief that our cause was just and that it was by God‚Äôs hand that we would prevail. ¬†

And so on Wednesday, July 8th let all God loving members of the American family and across the globe unite in prayer that first begins by acknowledging that without Jesus Christ we can do nothing and with Jesus Christ all things are possible for His glory.

How pathetic that in the era of information we're still falling pray to poorly written, out-dated, evidence lacking, illliterature. This is why the U.S. gets so much flak, because we're a broken nation and the root of it is religion i.e, lack of reason, sheer stubbornness.

Let me check my memory and I see there was another government entity in the last millennium ¬†that was also UN-ELECTED and served for their entire life, that‚Äôs right, a KING. History tells us what our founding fathers thought of such a government entity when they gave King George V a big ‚ÄúF ¬†you‚Äù when they signed the Declaration of Independence. Today we have ¬†a Supreme Court that is governing just like a king, using judicial decrees to make law, a form of judicial activism that has no legitimate place in the highest court of the land. If the Supreme Court wants to become a political entity of our three branches of government, of which in my opinion they have firmly established with their recent rulings, then they should be subject to the same process as the other two branches, the legislative and executive, and that is an ELECTION. No longer should Supreme Court justices be nominated by the president and then approved by the senate. These justices should be elected by the people through a national election, like any other political entity in a DEMOCRACY."

I also said, ""You are the worst driver i've ever seen."" He let me go and as far as i could see he drove more carefully after that."
0.0,This was a great video. I like how this gentleman questioned the officer with a very strong knowledge of the use of unmarked vehicles. This is actually how a actual cop should approach a vehicle. They should walk up and say ‚Äúdo you know why I pulled you over‚Äù without drawn gun. Then they explain why. This doesn‚Äôt happen in the videos I have seen with violence.

2.0,"When I was a kid some gigantically fat, gross woman told me I had to leave a public pool because I was upsetting young children because of my leg (I am an amputee). She even put her hands on me to physically force me to leave the pool area, at which point the life guards (and letter the police) got involved. 
     Never mind that I had every right to use the pool and had paid to be there.
     Also, I have been an amputee for 48 years now (since I was 3) and yea, little kids are sometimes scared, but mostly they are curious. If I can talk to them (always with parents permission) they stop being scared right away.
     When I worked at a resort I was swimming laps on my day off when I saw a little girl, about 4 with my fake leg trying to give it to her terrified looking dad.
    The kid was German and was trying to tell her dad, ""Daddy, someone for got their leg. You need to find them and give it back before they fall over.""
    Dad was thinking, ""Oh god, my kid has found someone's prosthetic leg and is playing with it. What should I say if the owner sees this?""
    Well his nightmare had come true. The owner had seen it, but thought it was hella funny.
    Though the child spoke only German, and I spoke only English the father, once he realized I was not upset was happy to translate.
     I was able to tell the child about my leg through her father. The kid was extremely sweet. After I explained about my leg and got her to put it back, she said something and patted my head (I was in the pool at this point) that caused her dad to laugh. She had said, ""You poor man. Not only is your leg gone, you can't even talk.""

So I listened, and his interviews where serviceable, and he had no great insight into anything with his commentary. Like most of his show was pleasant enough background, but the level his listeners think he's so smart and the $100 million dollar is baffling. Like he wasn't even a good entertainer really. Like Rush Limbaugh was a horrible man, but his show could be entertaining, and he was a brilliant broadcaster, if not a great commentator who would often say horrific things. However he could stretch nothing into hours of content. Rogan doesn't even have that going for him. So, basically, I don't get this guy at all.

But you don‚Äôt have to go to hell. Jesus Christ tells us that whosoever repents of their sins and trusts in him can be saved. Jesus paid the penalty of your sins on the cross at Calvary two thousands years ago.

2.0,If you listened to his podcast you might have heard him say he already had his medical treatment in place if he caught covid. That wasn't panicking. As for the vaccine it is not a cure all. Evidence now points to it offsetting the worst effects of covid but you will need a booster 6 months after your second vaccination given it is now proven that it's efficacy drops to 40% after that initial period

Jesus Christ tells us that unless you‚Äôre born again you will not see the kingdom of God. You will be judged for your sins; all of the lies, the immoral thoughts, stealing, blaspheming and justly sentenced to hell.

But you don‚Äôt have to go to hell. Jesus Christ tells us that whosoever repents of their sins and trusts in him can be saved. Jesus paid the penalty of your sins on the cross at Calvary two thousands years ago. 

What sin is worth an eternity in hell? Think how precious your eyes are to you, what would it take to sell your eyes? And how much for valuable the soul that looks out of those eyes? Don‚Äôt go to hell, repent and trust in Jesus and be saved."

Once we lose faith in the air we breathe we are deeply at a lost . Never chose to wear a mask outside since mask wearing became prevalent nor have any interest in taking a vaccination. Are we forgetting the power of our own immunity system. I cherish the sciences as well as a healthy lifestyle. The immunity systems will fight off anything if we took care of ourselves accordingly. Stop allowing your system to turn into a garbage disposal. Take time to do some form of exercise.

2.0,"On 6 Jan 2021 the Congress was discussing the possibility of an illegal election. Before the 1st protested state, Arizona, had the full evidence of the irregularities exposed... a fully orchestrated, illegal, domestic terrorist backed riot took place in the Capitol. The intent of the ""deep state"" was realized when the riot stopped the legitimate debate on the issue at hand. Congress was evacuated and the debate stopped. The Capitol was cleared of rioters, and later that evening, Congress returned and, as expected, the fire for finding the problem had burned out, as the ""deep state"" planned it. There are videos of Capitol Police waving the protestors onto the Capitol lawn and into the building. According to some, facial recognition software has identified ""Antifa"" members in the rioting crowd. As they did in the summer riots, normally peaceful people were antagonized by the anti fascists and followed along. The end result was attained... justifying the means. Debate stopped and Biden was certified by unchallenged slates of electoral votes. The Georgia challenge and the few challenges that came afterward received overwhelming votes against and the electoral protest procedure was halted in tis tracks. Not unexpectedly, there were soon calls from the left for V.P. Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the POTUS... and if he doesn't agree, we will start impeachment proceedings. The ""deep state"" has tried for 4 years to remove Donald J. Trump from office an they will not stop... even 12 days before the end of his term. ""He is dangerous!"", they say. ""He incited a riot!"", they say. The truth is, that with the intelligence that he still has access to... he is a threat to their illegal livelihood and has been for 4 years. It scares them to death that their truths may be revealed. For the left and the deep state, it is truly a matter of life and death to remove Trump. As Hillary Clinton said, (paraphrased), ""If that S.O.B. gets elected, we'll all hang by nooses."" Truer words were never spoken. Donald Trump was not as vindictive as he should have been, and he allowed them to slide. BIG MISTAKE!!!! A majority of the left and a goodly portion of the right are involved in enriching themselves from activities that are surely less than above board in the USA. They all fear the consequences. Some would surely face death for their crimes. We can only pray that justice will be served."

If I had to be identified politically, I'm left, and I'm really tired of white people panic with all the PC titles. 

No one I know has ever asked the person they felt should be offended IF they are offended. They just assume. It makes me nuts."

1.0,"Actually, the offended cancel culture babies have taken something away from the Native American by denying them tributes to their ancestry. Those titles of teams as respectful and honorable. It is a shame the Indian nation did not see it that way and come in defense of the team and themselves.  This isn't the first time this has happened. The cancel culture couldn't care less if the native American dropped out of sight into obscurity and eventual extinction.  
Shame on the native Americans for not speaking out in defense of themselves."
2.0,"Redskins is racism towards native Americans apparently. 
Imagine if a team was named ‚ÄúBlack skins‚Äù people would be offended and call it racism towards black people. 
If a team was called White skins people would say it‚Äôs white supremacy. Funny how that works"

0.0,Breaking news: Native Americans are able to have varying opinions. I too am a Native American and I am against Native mascots in areas where Natives are a minority. I shockingly have the audacity not to speak for other people so yes there are Natives who aren't offended and yes there are Natives who are against Native mascots. I don't know who needs to hear this but Native people don't get together and decide a collective opinion and then the rest of us have to follow it.
2.0,"The Redskins can avoid the racist charge by changing their mascot to a Redskin Potato! :-)

Many teams have aggressive names: the Bears, the Bengals (tigers), the Eagles, etc.  In a similar vein, the name Redskin was chosen because American Indians were viewed as tough warriors.  It was really intended as a compliment.

The people claiming that Redskins is a racist term have not been able to find a single documented instance of the term Redskins being used in a derogatory manner since the 1920s.  It's doubtful there is single person alive who has heard the term Redskins used as a racial slur.  The meanings of a word sometimes changes and the word Redskins is one such word.  Redskin hasn't been a slur in at least a century."
1.0,See they don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs just white liberals taking away heritage
2.0,Isn't it racist to change the name and logo? Change the color red also
2.0,Gary Clark of the Washington Redskins conducted at least 3 football camps at Native American reservations during his career. He wanted to know if they thought the Redskins name was racist. What he saw was Native Americans wearing Redskins gear and saying that they were proud to be a Redskin fan and the 5% that weren‚Äôt Redskins fans were Cowboys fans and that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt like the name.

Landlords can continue to make security deposits over false notions and make people's lives worse. The houses are not necessarily being torn down. They're just converted.

They have left themselves with no choice, except to annihilate their enemies, or be annihilated, & that is exactly how they behave - like all the Palestinians must be annihilated, all their land taken, in order for Israel to exist, at all. That is a corner they backed themselves into - when they showed no willingness to show compassion to their fellow humans, or seek out peace, thru diplomacy - always resorting to brute force to achieve purely selfish ends, instead of cultivating peaceful relations, in a land they reside in, thanks only to the concessions others have made, on their behalf.

Your dealing with some very nasty, corrupt individuals, that will stop at nothing, to cheat to win. An example is the last Supreme Court judge that shows how evil they are. Again they have cheated in the past when they didn't have the votes and changed it to 50 votes to win. You never trust Moscow Mitch McConnell and you should know that by now. You want to do something positive, start getting the people in the Republican Party with all the criminal activity they have done in the last plus decade. Get them removed from office and put in prison if possible. There supporters don't care how corrupt Trump and the Republicans are. The more corrupt they are the better they like it. You saw who supports them and the type of people they are. It's going to be interesting how hard the punishment will be for the people that were arrested for the insurrection, who was involved in the planning, and weapons that were used to murder the people that lost their life and the type of injuries that caused their wounds.

As such, male masturbation will be closely monitored and prohibited as it does not occur without external stimulation. Sex without procreative intent will be discouraged and you can bet birth control will be next to go. Any age restricted right will be measured from conception, obviously. The definition of life will need revision. Basic science and the seven characteristics of life no longer apply. So many nonliving things just became living. I‚Äôm not sure about this one but if the pregnancy or childbirth kills the mother doesn‚Äôt that make the person responsible the fetus? How would that work? Anyways- point is this whole idea is a stupid front for punishing and controlling women. You can bet that the rich will be getting abortions for their wives and the other poor women they knock up.

And white privilege  might exist, but the overly simplified heuristic that is used when discussing white privilege deeply flawed. One can't assume that just because  someone is white, they are automatically  privileged.

White privilege is the truth that, if one of those people were black, their life would be harder and they would have to deal with more issues than they do currently.

Do you even know why we have devaluation in the dollar?  Do you know how fiat currency actually works and the global coordination of currency markets?  

We had moderate to mild inflation for several decades until Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1970, which crashed the economy throughout the 70s.  Yet, we still managed to have no carry over debt for programs - even Vietnam.  But in the 70s, we started borrowing money like crazy from Japan, to the point where  a minister of education suggested we cede Hawaii to them in exchange for writing off the debt. 

Carter used monetarism to increase inflation significantly which lowered the value of the dollar to repay the Japanese their dollar indexed funds.  This decrease the amount we owed them by billions of dollars.  Yes, stagflation: double digit interest rates, double digit inflation and double digit unemployment.  Short term pain (like 8 years) for long term gain of not carrying foreign debt. 

But Congress couldn't control its spending, and decided to leverage the funds in social security instead.  Throughout the 80s and 90s that's where we borrowed from thus increasing the total debt.  Various members of Congress then opined mightily about the impending crash of Social Security and that it should be privatized, like Chile did.  Except, Chile's program crashed and burned. 

We've been borrowing money for 40 years.   Mysterious, uncontrolled digital currency won't change anything other than create yet another ponzi scheme where the people who get in first, profit and the people who get in late lose money.

As one of the dominant currencies in global currency baskets, mismoves by Congress or the Federal Reserve can have catastrophic global consequences.    

About crypto?  Who owns it?  Who oversees it?  Nobody  We see Elon Musk quite reliably pumping Dogecoin with a few weeks at the end of his fiscal quarter, and then dumping it a week after the books close.  

Bitcoin is heavily used by terrorists around the world for ransomware.  The mythical value is the anonymity, yet governments are showing success at seizing wallets used for crime.    Speaking of criminal terrorists, North Korea is one of the leading countries that use crypto for criminal activity.

If you lose all value in your crypto, the way it has happened to many people - who do you deal with to get partial indemnification or a refund?

Nobody.  Nobody.  This is exactly the model that caused multiple financial collapses in the United States from 1830 through 1880.  Five complete financial collapse, bank runs and depressions that lasted for years. 

Because of these collapses, we created the Federal Reserve to oversee currency and debt.  The closest we've come to a collapse was 2008 because of speculative investments.  Sound familiar?  That cost us more than $1 trillion to bring under control.

We have the FDC which exists to oversee financial institutions to protect consumers in the event of a collapse.  No crypto is FDC backed, meaning - a collapse in any crypto leaves it's investors without recourse, and no government backing means they'll never see a cent of it again.

That's why we don't support crypto  It's the subprime mortgage of financial instruments."
2.0,"My point exactly, USD is backed by the conglomerate agreedness that the US government will catch us if we fall. Just because USD is backed by the government doesn't make it's value any less psychological.

People made the same argument when we made the move away from gold backed USD. A new medium of exchange is necessary for a global economy to evolve. Using the empire of the United states of America as a basis for a financial system globally won't work forever."

Lost wallets are not redeemed, stolen data, fraudulent exchanges can not be fought.

Most the people showing up have big financial interests in getting certain things done.  If we want democracy to work, we need to be more active in it.

2.  Vote in every election, especially at the local level.  The local level has huge influence on your day to day life, your vote carries more weight at the local level, and our next national level candidates have to get their start somewhere.  Voting in every election also means doing your homework.  Get to know the candidates.  For my most recent state delegate primary, I had a chance to talk with both the individuals on the ballot and got a solid feel for both.  It was clear the less funded guy was better to me, but he lost pretty decisively.  So few people do the homework so the woman with the slick mailers won.

3.  Run yourself.  As I already said, democracy only works if we work it.  If the people running aren't getting the job done, then someone else needs to step up.  And frankly, I'd rather vote for the reluctant candidate running to do the right thing than the person who really wants power.  I'm afraid of people who want power.

You'll notice my advice has nothing to do with this particular issue.  That's because if we don't get the foundation right, we will never be able to get the big stuff right.  It's all hard work I propose, no easy answers I fear."

Gop uses that to con people into saying dems want to control our lives. Which is what they want to do while claiming they are getting govt off people backs. Whatever that means.

1.0,"No it doesn't. Nor does it have to have ""exceptions for life of the mother"" either. The latter is the only possibly compelling exception and even then it falls flat on its face because in no other realm is failure to medically save (in this case the baby) applicable to murder. 

You cannot fail to save with malice aforethought and despite taking every reasonable action still murder the person. That's just nonsense because the malice aforethought part is contradictory to the actions trying to save another. Doctors aren't perfect and fail to save people all the time and it's not murder. So why would it be any different for the unborn child that you suggest abortion be legal so that they can be killed? It doesn't make sense. Either the child is going to die regardless what you do and you can save the mother, or the child lives and the mother lives.

So no, the law doesn't need to make any exceptions for this. If you murder the child, you should be punished. Period."

Plus if Harris gets 25thed into the white house between now and then, it's even worse because everybody will be coming out to stop her. That's why Biden only did the commission instead of just nominating new justices. Also Pelosi's commission isn't really moving very well. Even the social media platforms, facebook included are starting to regret propping up the democrats because now they want to come after them with regulations not to make them uphold free speech which they were afraid of under Trump, but to censor more than they can handle without hurting their bottom line.

Now i sadly watch my dad fall deeper and deeper into this political hole and lose care for everything.
1.0,"That is an interesting question and I think you are seeing the statements that conservatives typically make regarding individual liberty (i should be able to make my own decisions because I am free to do so, I just have to deal with the consequences of that decision) and relating it to this issue. Is that the case? I'm sorry if it isn't, that's just the connection that I see and would appreciate clarification if I'm incorrect. 
I think the distinction is that we regard the pregnant woman and the unborn baby as individuals with inherent value simply because they are human. That idea has ramifications. We believe both of those individuals have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. So because the baby is a living individual, it has a right to life and should be provided that as much as we are able. Additionally, the destruction of a life, which we would say begins at conception, at the hands of another is murder, which is something we believe is wrong.
I hope this helps. If you have any more questions or would like to discuss things more, feel free to dm me. I know I'm not always the best at clearly articulating my view, so I would be glad to discuss it further."

2.0,What is your basis for the punishment for murder? Or do you not believe murderers should be punished?
2.0,"It is encouraging to hear that my response was helpful. Thank you.
I agree that is important to listen to the opposing side. I find i often become arrogantly certain that I am absolutely correct when I either just think through it on my own or only listen to those that agree with me. But hearing the other side often adds perspective or brings up things that I didn't consider. This doesn't always change my position, but it helps me consider more aspects than I originally did which is important to having opinions about the world as a whole and how different things work together."
2.0,Murder of a human or murder of a fetus?
0.0,"I get that ""pro-life"" see life at conception, but why not also support adequate sex education and contraceptives instead of abstinence only to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and welfare to help these kids after they are born so the mother doesn't feel like she needs to abort because she has no future?"
2.0,Just murder. Or rape. Or any crime that should be punished. What is your basis for punishing crime in general?
1.0,"Thank you for your questions. As before I think those are important questions to ask especially since they can have a big impact on the lives of people involved. 
Would you expand on what sex education would look like? I think I would agree that sex education is important. I don't always agree with how it is put into practice (for example I live in a state that begins sex education in kindergarten. In my opinion that is far too early to begin discussing that topic). So if you clarify what you would desire in that regard, I could give you my opinion in that area. 
In regards to your point on abstinence verses other options, my personal belief is that sex is something reserved for marriage. In holding that view, I acknowledge that others do not hold that view. So I would hold abstinence as the ideal. That's what I believe people should do, but since they aren't going to, providing instruction in the other areas would be beneficial, but I would still emphasize the ideal. I don't believe contraceptives are wrong, I just don't think they are best before marriage. 
I think another reason abstinence is promoted over the other options is that no matter how effective the other options are, there is still a chance that it doesn't work, while with abstinence, it should be entirely effective because if you don't participate in the act that gets you pregnant, you can't get pregnant. Actions have consequences, if you do not want to be pregnant or to deal with a child, the most effective way to prevent that is to avoid participating in the activity that results in pregnancy. If you participate in that activity, you risk the result. 
I don't know that this specifically answers your questing, but one objection I personally would have to welfare being used as a solution is I don't believe it is the government's job to take care of children whose parents would struggle to provide for them. Instead I would say it is the responsibility of the people in that community to come alongside that mother and assist her in the provision and raising of that child. One of the ways this manifests is through charity like Pregnancy Resource Center and individuals seeing the need of that mother and child. 
If a person is truly holding to the pro-life view, they must continue to value the life of that child after they are born and so must be willing to do what it takes to protect that life. The child doesn't cease to be valuable as a human just because they have left the protection of their mother's womb. 
As before I hope I was helpful. If you have any questions or would like clarification, you are welcome to dm me. Thank you for your time."

Also, note that not all, but a lot of times when republicans disagree with stats its because there is a reason to besides they hurt my feelings. Like there are conflicting reports. Like a month or so ago when the CDC said Florida's daily covid death rates where through the roof, but come to find out the CDC had messed up the data and took a 3 day death total and displayed it as happening in 2 days. There were news articles proving this mistake, in that instance, yes republicans disagreed with stats because they were proven wrong.  


On that note I am giving you a chance to prove this wrong.

2.0,"You are right, in this statistic you need to take into account weather getting that statistic uses a general definition of rape or if it uses it's own countries law or definition of rape which it's actually surprising how laws differ extremely from country to country.

However even if their using the country of origins laws you would still have to wonder why Denmark has a low rape count? Do they have extremely strict laws or are they hiding their cases from us? Does Denmark stack up in comparison to other western countries(where the laws would be somewhat similar, obviously there would be some differences between them all) and would that show us something vastly different in comparison?

Also, if you were to look at the stat through a different lens like ""ohh well Denmark is just more civil"" or something of the sort then suddenly this has a vastly different meaning to what is presented as truth.

In other words, this statistic paints a pretty incomplete picture and it would help if it had something to drive the point home that wasn't itself."

And to this fact, there is no arguing.  There are entire libraries filled with books about how statistics can be misleading and purposefully deceitful.  

To reiterate and be clear, I simply disagreed with the prevailing sentiment and pointed out that statistics can be misleading. I have not done research into this specific instance, and I don‚Äôt care to.

As far as statistics being misleading, I am not going to link a bunch of articles you probably won‚Äôt read."
2.0,Less reported rapes* or else the families honor is shot
2.0,"Yup, in their culture it's not rape, shouldn't be in the same graph.

And you essentially refuse to take it, saying you don't care to research the topic and based on your edit only spoke up in defiance of the information because you want to mirror republican behavior.

But like I said, and proved, above. When we disagree we often have evidence to back it up. We don't disagree because the information provided hurt our feelings.

Also you say stats can be and are manipulated. I 100% agree with you. I have an example.

The other day I saw a news clip that said, ""vaccinated people have a 99.999% survival rate. Unvaccinated people are 25 times more likely to die"" that sounds drastic! 99.999% survival rate vs 25 times more likely to die... Let's do that math.

100 - 99.999 = 0.001 (chance of death while vaccinated)

0.001 x 25 = 0.025 (25 times more likely to die while unvaccinated)

100 - 0.025 = 99.975% chance of survival for unvaccinated people.

Yet people are losing careers over vaccine mandates... For a vaccine that doesn't prevent you from contracting or transmitting. It doesn't even prevent you from dying. For an experimental technology (mRNA) that has never gone past lab trials before this year so there is ZERO long term effect studies.

See when republicans reject things, we typically have logic and facts to justify our stance."

Denmark is the fifth most safe country in the world, and while mainstream news admits there are issues in respect to this area,



The reality is that reporting lags behind. I don‚Äôt know the reason for this, but since under reporting is rampant, it makes sense that criminal convictions would follow suit.  Instead of blaming a minority, this article describes a traumatizing process as the major issue.



This article expands on how antiquated the laws are, specifically calling for changes to acquaintance rape, the most common type of rape.  

The statistics are misleading because people are using it push a false narrative which blames refugees coming from a particular locality. It fails to account for the realities of the law and the people living there.  In short, statistics are misleading, and some people in this community are pushing their own narrative instead of actually doing the legwork."

It's the American people aka private citizens that should be calling them out.

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature‚Äôs God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation‚Ä¶.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.‚ÄîThat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. ‚Äî That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness‚Ä¶ it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.****"

The exception is orders that are illegal - soldiers are expected to disobey an illegal order - however, they will have to defend doing so in a court martial (though in wartime they might not make it that far).

The issue here is that this Lt. Colonel was not personally given an illegal order, so he had no grounds to disobey one.  At present, we don't know of any other instance where anyone involved was given an illegal order.  We know lots of **stupid** orders were given, but even so, not to this LTC.

He blatantly disregarded intelligence, armed the Taliban to the teeth so when we inevitably go in next it will be a slaughter, and made one of the worst military decisions possibly any president has made. 

We abandoned our allies, are openly being disrespected across the world, and made this world a lot more dangerous of a place because of his immaturity. 

Or are we going to talk about the blatant disrespect for every dead service member brought home according to a barrage of witnesses‚Äô and gold star families?  

This president is effectively the sole reason for tens of thousands of deaths and ensured many more to come in the future. 

Calling out this administration for the blatant disregard for human life is only right, if he faces jail time so be it, he did the right thing.

Still millions of Americans out of work because our economy is shit. Democrats extended unemployment way too long and paid bonuses to people too lazy to look for a job. Many businesses closed because they couldn't find workers. 
 So you're full of crap if you think a majority support attacking an honest General that told the truth about Afganistan. Even the deep state leaked Bidens phone call with the Afganistan president asking him to lie about the Taliban having power."

I think it was more so those that came after them would know what should be done and create a legal path todo so. I'm sure no lawyer but it seems to be more than justification but a warning to be prepared for future tyranny.

I definitely agree with the love it or leave it part tho. I think more than a few need to have their citizenship revoked and sent out of the country and some should be held accountable for their actions that have lead to our current situation."
1.0,"What happened to the military officers like Alexander Vindman who not only criticized Trump, he lied under oath for a phony impeachment?

No charges were  given to Vindman even after he was caught lying."

For commissioned officers it is indeed different. My point is there‚Äôs a different between morals and laws. 

He was have been limited by law in technically, but morally he had an obligation to defend the honor and the lives of the service members serving under him. 

Countlessly the president and other high appointed officials, military and not do things that are blatantly against the UCMJ and against the law. Almost never do they face repercussions, and even very little do they receive scrutiny, that is as long as it sides with the left viewpoint that almost every corporation sector  and power house in this country supports."
2.0,The reality of Military service
1.0,"Correct.  What immoral or unethical order was Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller given, that he had a duty to disobey?

Contrary to leftist belief, *not liking* the President or senior officers does not grant military personnel carte blanche to disobey their lawful orders or act disrespectfully toward them."

2.0,Then he should have resigned his commission and then complained - citizen presidents don't get court martials bc their not soldiers - who was the last president some country didn't want tried for war crimes - they don't get a fcking opinion - nor does a commissioned officer - period
2.0,The UCMJ and code of conduct clearly restricts speech of any enlisted or commissioned officer in the military.  You might need a crash course on military law.
2.0,"No, abandoning our people and actively arming a terrorists organization is plenty of ammunition to question what the hell is going on.  If you can‚Äôt even admit that point, I don‚Äôt see a reason in continuing this conversation."
2.0,"Yeah like the the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military department who are also covered and who I assume probably had something to do with the withdrawal - it's getting sad now"
2.0,Do you personally believe the current president and his administration have become a danger to America?
2.0,So your saying the declaration of independence is nothing but paper or our constitution?
2.0,"Go ahead and look up the hatch act and DOD Directive 1344.10. 

The UCMJ directly states commissioned officers."
1.0,"> No, abandoning our people and actively arming a terrorists organization is plenty of ammunition to question what the hell is going on.

It absolutely is.  However, those don't relate to orders Lt. Colonel Scheller was given.

His first video was a violation of Article 88 of the UCMJ.  His second video was a violation of that, and arguably Article 94 also, because it included the statement  ""Follow me, and we will bring the whole [expletive] system down"".  The possible penalties for violation of Article 88 are dismissal, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for one year.  Article 94 has the potential to carry a death penalty.

Biden and the senior officers under his command did a lot of bad things, and they should all spend time in prison.  ...but what Scheller did was dumb."
2.0,"The declaration of independence was a document explaining why British citizens were overthrowing their government and included specific examples of abuses by the king to justify why they were doing it to gather support from other British subjects living in the colonies and other European powers.

The Constitution was created to create a new constitutional republic to replace a failing confederacy of states. It includes a blue print for how this government should operate and how it can be changed through constitutional amendments. All states ratified this through a vote making it the new law of the land.

The bill of rights were added later through the amendment process established in the constitution because it was the law of the land. 

There is no, we declared independence so you can legally do it whenever you want clause.

Again, you want a revolution prepare to get bloody. And if that's you intention, quit pussy footing around, declare you rebellion and get to fighting"
2.0,"Well the only thing evil need to spread is for good men to do nothing. 

I would rather find peaceful legal solution. However I won't choose doing nothing while evil destroys our country and the American way of life. 
My family had fought in every war this nation has ever been in from the 1st to the last. I won't be the one to change that. While it scares the hell out of me, I won't comply with what my heart tells me is wrong."
2.0,"So when does your declaration of independence get released. 

The colonists had 27 abuses and usurpations by the king to justify their treason. Let's start with the abuses and usurpations you feel the Constitutional Republic has completed against you."

1.0,so true. the USA should take note. ugh nvm we got Joe and the hoe running the circus.
0.0,"Sorry, but this data is completely made up.  Please check the government sites for Sweden and Israel for factual data.  Also, no country is currently on their 3rd shot of vaccine in other than critical care deployments.   This is just designed to rile people up and try to prove a point that isn‚Äôt supported by either measured fact or by critical reasoning.  Vaccines work.  Masks work.  Social distancing works.  The USA proved this was effective under both Trump and Biden.  Now we‚Äôre suffering again thanks to people spreading these lies.  Viruses mutate.  That‚Äôs why we get a different flu vaccine every year.  Covid mutated in the the more aggressive and dangerous Delta variant.  Now people with no defenses, folks who refuse to get vaccinated, are being hit hard.  This sucks and is completely avoidable.  How do I know this.  I‚Äôve got two doctors in my family, both working ICUs.  Both watching people suffer and die.  Direct observation of fact.  Please get vaccinated and end this.

Edit:  As I noted in a follow up comment below, I was looking at the unvaccinated occurrence of infection, not the overall country rate.  But this also bought up the key difference in vaccination between Sweden and Israel.  Sweden is far more vaccinated than Israel is.  Hence lower  Hence relaxation of mask and social distancing.  Vaccinate and wear masks to help protect the unvaccinated."
2.0,The county we live in has nearly 100% vax participation and the R-eff has been 0.9 for almost two weeks. Mask mandates still in place...

0.0," boosters just started so that‚Äôs not relevant. 

Look at Sweden‚Äôs vaccination rate. Additionally because mask mandates don‚Äôt exist doesn‚Äôt mean people aren‚Äôt wearing masks and distancing because they are.  Nordics take community efforts seriously and usually don‚Äôt need to be mandated to do the right thing."
2.0,"This is really true data, and it‚Äôs not a bad two groups to pit against each other, they are both relatively small countries that are mostly homogenous racially, and the only true difference is claimed it (and I do wonder if that has anything to do with it, the Middle East is‚Ä¶ Well, desert, and isn‚Äôt Sweden fairly cold?)"

Practically no one wears mask, if someone does it is almost always old people and they usually wear the good tightly fitted ones. Slightly more people wear on public transport, some put them on just when they travel. Walking in central stockholm, maybe 1 in 100 you see wear mask. Cashiers and working people are some times required to wear one. Mostly people stopped caring.  

[Here is Stockholm, July '21, 600 people [sound]]("
2.0,"Sweden is also over 10x larger with a significantly higher income population and a similar population size, most of their mandates that restricted public crowding and enforced social distancing were lifted in mid-July. In terms of vaccination, Sweden is at about 60%, and while climate can affect viral transmission, it is likely in large part to Sweden's much lower population density that we see these numbers"

0.0,"You are correct.  I was looking at unvaccinated case rates, not country wide case rates.  That was my mistake and I apologize for the error.  The statistic that‚Äôs missing here is the country wide vaccination rate.  Sweden is far ahead of Israel on that which is what‚Äôs driving their low case rate

Message stays the same.  Wear a mask.  Get Vaccinated.  If you‚Äôre sick, stay away from others.  This is basic healthcare stuff that we‚Äôve known about for several centuries."
1.0,"They were supposed to be, but it turns out the bigger the crowd of people that don't give a shit, the less reported cases there are. Anyone that got sick probably hung out at home and thought to themselves, "" well shit I'm sick "" then a few days later felt better just like 99% of everyone else that gets this.   They didn't go on national TV and talk about their positive test and how everyone should get vaccinated, so the news is not interested."

2.0,"Doctors have a duty to do no harm, if you wanted lots of pain killers that could stop your breathing and kill you, there‚Äôs a limit to what they will give since they can‚Äôt practice what would be literal suicide at that point. Also there are laws. In the case of a doctor won‚Äôt intubate or use resuscitative measures if you have that signed along with other treatment modalities you can chose to refuse. Plus depending on the drug many have drug-drug interactions that could either enhance or decrease the current efficacy of medications you‚Äôre on based on its metabolism. Lastly it‚Äôs for prevention of law suits. Let‚Äôs say you ask for a bunch of random medication and survive yet have side effects that cause permanent damage or require surgery or other things, now you‚Äôll be suing the hospital. 

Lastly in the case of this tweets correlation doesn‚Äôt equal causation. Ivermectin is used to treat parasites. People are buying animal formulations and overdosing themselves, and the media is having a field day calling it medicine. Just like I‚Äôve seen people struggling financially use animal antibiotics and getting deathly sick or using insulin doses for pets. Covid is a virus. Viruses aren‚Äôt alive. Just like antibiotics which work on bacteria wouldn‚Äôt help in this case, neither would anti fungal medication. 

I also don‚Äôt understand why the people who adamantly argue that this virus is a hoax or man made or not that serious and won‚Äôt get vaccinated or wear a mask suddenly feel so scared of it that they have to take ivermectin.  

Next thing you know, covid patients are gonna be asking for chemo and radiation to kill everything in their body."
2.0,"Yes, the hypocrite oath. Yes, assisted suicide is for the most part illegal in the US. I am familiar with DNRs, I used to be a paramedic and worked in a trauma center.

However, if I was in sound mind and sighed a liability waver or give power of attorney to a family member, thus relasing the attending physician of any and all legal liability prior to my contraction of ANY virus or illness, why not?  The virus is not a hoax but, my job allows me to view certain government materials. The last brief I read was that COVID spread was ""very unlikely"" to be spread naturally. ""More than likely"" leak out the lab, however not meant to be a bio agent. 

I do not believe any virus is a hoax, we have pictures of them. That was not my argument."
2.0,I mean I support the whole your body your choice thing. I‚Äôm only a 4th year medical student so I can‚Äôt speak from too much experience yet. I think if the person is willing to pay and like you said of sound mind and judgement and doesn‚Äôt hold anyone liable then by all means. But they shouldn‚Äôt then go and claim whatever worked for them as a miracle cure without further testing since there are many factors that go into play. And a sample size of 1 is meaningless.

2.0,"So this is what I worry about‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve followed TYT for years, but recently they made a very convenient edit to videos from Jimmy Dore, regarding alleged sexual harassment towards Ana Kasparian. As I stated before, I‚Äôm not a fan of jimmy Dore at all, but his comments were about Kasparian being unprofessional with her work attire, and framing it as a joke. What he said was, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a nice ‚Äúnews‚Äù skirt‚Äù‚Äî  They played a clip of Dore saying, (this is not verbatim) ‚Äúi made her feel terrible, and ashamed‚Ä¶ I did that‚Äù ‚Äî then the clip stops and Cenk calls him a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù. Right after the clip cuts off, Dore finishes his comment by explaining how terrible it was that he made her feel that way, and then he apologized. 
‚Äî‚Äî with that said, I‚Äôm voting for Newsom, don‚Äôt like Elder, but I‚Äôm very curious about what he said after the clip stopped, because it was very abrupt. Elder doesn‚Äôt seem like he is advocating for paying slave owners reparations. The point he seems to be making is that it was legal to have slaves, so if reparations were paid out, an argument could be made for the slave owners receiving reparations as well. He didn‚Äôt sound like he was advocating for that, but just making a point on reparations as a whole. If I were to make a guess, he was making an argument against reparations, not making a point that slave owners should be paid as well."

Elder opened my eyes on the matter. Made me contemplate some important questions and consider things I had not considered. 

Would Rachel dolezal get reparations? Would Oprah Winfrey? Obama? Kamala Harris? When today there are FAR more poverty stricken white people in America than any other people. Do all black people get reparations even though many NEVER had relatives who were enslaved? What about those black people whose families were actually slave OWNERS? There were many. Who pays these reparations? All white people? All citizens whether they had anything to do with the slave trade or not? Republican families who sacrificed their own flesh and blood to liberate the slaves and end the infamous traffic? People whose families never even lived in the country until maybe 100 years after the infamous traffic of slavery had ended? They owe, too? The South was home to 250,000 free blacks. Do their descendants get reparations, too? There were ~4000 black slave owners owning more than 20,000 slaves. How does that figure into ‚ÄúReparations‚Äù?¬†Since the country‚Äôs founding 306,000 slaves were brought here, but since slavery ended more than 2,000,000 black Africans have come here by choice... another 1,000,000 Black Americans came here by choice and by way of the Caribbean. how does THAT figure into reparations?

Because of Larry elder it now seems to me that the only proper way to handle the inequities of the past is to make sure that our laws are just TODAY. That they‚Äôre applied equally to every citizen. To continue to provide access to opportunity WITHOUT favoring or handicapping ANY racial group.¬†I think that‚Äôs the best we‚Äôve got."

2.0,"CENK! I admire you but the way you silenced Ana here was prettier horrendous. This was after all a section introduced and presented by her about the Taliban literally holding new media hostage in Afghanistan. You decided to steal the segment by turning it into an attack on your American media rivals. When Ana tried to respond to this you cut her off repeatedly and then said ""hold on"" which suggests you will allow her to respond at the end. But once you made your point you ended the section without allowing her any retort. 
The Taliban taking total control of the media is an important story but you dismissed it and silenced Ana voice by wagging your finger at her and then holding your hand up to silence her in a very dictatorial fashion. 
This came off terribly. I'm not saying this as some sort of fan of Ana, I actually think she too often doesn't do her due diligence before reporting on a story and it clearly shows but as a boss I would never raise my voice to literally drown out the voice of a female staff member while wagging my finger at her and then use the ""stop!"" hand gesture to silence them. You are meant to be a progressive.
I hope you read this as that was very dictatorial behaviour and is a nasty window into your workplace behaviour."

2.0,"This man is one of the reasons I respect people who serve our country with honor and respect. I‚Äôm not just talking about people who wear the uniforms eitherüòí. Chief Acevedo made a good point where our problems lie. If you want things to change in your favor then you need to vote for it. Also, I know that this is old news but I really don‚Äôt understand why people always think violence is the answer. Look what this worldwide riot sparked from. Police brutality. I happen to respect the police department but when there is an officer who uses unnecessary force or worse goes against all protocol and what has been taught, then I lose that respect. Trump‚Äôs answer during this crazy situation was to ‚Äúdominate‚Äù. I was disappointed not just because of how he spoke to the governors but also that he decided to use force as a first solution. should never be a first solution, no matter the circumstances. Here‚Äôs why. First depending on who you‚Äôre picking a fight with and how many, they might beat you senseless. Second all you are doing is making yourself look like the bad guy which is okay if you‚Äôre trying to conquer someplace but not such a good a idea to do with your own nation. Finally we have a thing called diplomacy. Ever heard it? Been around since the Roman Imperial Era? It doesn‚Äôt just apply with political agendas, if you know the country then it applies just as well to the public. Talking things out isn‚Äôt a guarantee, especially in the ‚Äúfree country‚Äù, but in emergency situations it‚Äôs a better first option than sending the National Guard. Violence is always met with more violence."

When Trump back these hate groups you protected him, a P.R. statement saying you refuse to support racism, then back Trump's hatemongering declarations the very next day. 

Who are you people to accept racism as a political platform? When David Duke supports Trump you did nothing, just give me my Tax Cuts and my Judges Mr. Trump.¬† 

African Americans are being attacked on the streets by Americans for, cooking, sleeping, shopping by Trump Supporters you could care less. 

When Trump broke the law dealing with Russia you protected him again. 

¬† Meanwhile, the hate groups are getting stronger, Anti-Governments Groups increase, but you Republicans do nothing. 

I say this as an independent voter you have permitted Donald Trump to become an American Dictator to keep your power. 

He Attacked Black Lives Matter for his supremacist racist base, for a Photo Op. 
The Republicans did nothing, Terrorist attacked Michigan's Capital you did nothing to stop Trump. 
Trump told the Proud Boys, I'm with you 
The Republicans did nothing. 
The Capital Has Been Attacked and you have settled back and have allowed Donald Trump and his followers to commit treason.¬† 

I say this to you honestly all of you are cowards to the Ameican People. It might not feel that way with the backing of Right-Wing Media, The Power and Money you have gained. 

We all saw it though, time after time watching you allowing Trump to do anything he wanted. 

A police officer has died and yes every one of you Republicans is to blame for his death, Fox News can't help you spin out of this. 

There is no honor, no integrity, or compassion within your party. 

Why do you ignore white supremacy and their organizations? 

Time won't heal this one, you have shown us who you are and we will never forget. 

Never Forget.

Americans aren't being told the truth neither about Russia nor China. In fact, with respect to both, Americans are constantly told lies, especially about China. When Trump was saying let's make friends with Russia, I began to think that Trump really wants to free America from the control of the Deep State because making any deals with Russia is what the Deep State doesn't want, be they Neocons or Democrats. Trump acted like Democrats were preventing him from making friends with or even talking to Putin or having a negotiation, meanwhile he imposed sanctions after sanctions against Russia. Then, at the end of Trump's term, he truly waged a massive anti-China information campaign, similar to the one Reagan waged against the USSR. What this tells me is that Trump wanted to fool everyone that he is a nice guy who wants to make friends with Russia and others. This tells me that he is still down with the people who are interested in regime changes in Russia and China and are not interested in negotiations, which means that Trump isn't any better than Bush, Obama, Clinton, etc. He almost fooled me. I thought that Trump was against the DS, but he was with the Neocons. If he wasn't with the Neocons, then he was surrounded by them, which means that he just couldn't really do anything from the get go and he wasn't in control of anything. They only allowed him to do certain things and said no to everything else. It is a 2-party 1-party system and the president is just a puppet, whether it is Trump, Biden, Obama, or Santa Claus."
