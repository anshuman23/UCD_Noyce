"It's not that Latinos don't understand Democratic Socialism. It's that many have been burned in their home countries. Dictators like Chavez, Ortega and Castro all swore fealty to the democratic process before taking power and dismantling it. Then it doesn't help when leftists in this country make excuses for or play footsies with regimes everyone knows are savage. For example, it's difficult to explain the eye rolling and shock that Bernie Sanders caused when he insisted on talking about the good side of the Cuban dictatorship. And he still doesn't get why that rubbed so many the wrong way. It's not that people don't think literacy campaigns are good -- it's more like people said, Why are you even bringing that up? It's like pointing out that Mussolini made the trains run on time -- it misses the point. 

The Covid stuff is also huge. Latin Americans are just much more willing to accept risk in all areas of life and think people in the U.S. are deluding themselves when they think these rules are gonna save them. Latinos see overly protective measures as the worse of both worlds: it kills economic activity AND it doesn't protect as much as people think. That's a world view you can't change. It would help if public health measures were more often enacted in consultation with impacted communities -- ie lets have fewer top-down decisions. 

There are also other issues for sure. There is plenty of racism, classism and sexism in the Latino communities and Trump for sure knew how to exploit that. But the Democrats also did a horrible job -- they didn't do the prep work for four years that Trump and his people were doing. They swooped in the at the last minute and (quite arrogantly) assumed Latinos naturally identified with U.S. identity politics and they often don't. 

The solution entails countering rising right wing Spanish language media, reminding folks that it's the right that is against democracy, stressing health care and fairness for all, talking about progressive family values (every Latino knows a family with a gay member and most do not want them persecuted, for example), stressing the corruption of Trump and his disdain for poor people, etc... etc...

"I'm actually American now since 1995. We immigrated from just south of Montreal(Cornwall) to upstate NY. The sole reason, healthcare. My mothers cancer wasn't being treated by the Canadian system so we were seeing a private doctor in upstate NY. Eventually we immigrated there full time due to her condition and inability to travel. Of which she ended up surviving thankfully to the hospital staff and doctor in NY.

Time has since past and the state of NY started regulating healthcare way too much. They banned our doctor from making house calls and taking payments on a sliding scale. She'd only charge my parents what they could In come NYS regulations and all payment methods became fixed fees through insurance only. So our doctor went ahead and retired since she disagreed with the newly regulated rates we were now required to pay. Which put us in debt.

Either way, now I'm living in NC to get away from the same bloated system we left in Canada, then NY.  The voters there do not know or realize what they're asking for when they demand a Canadian style healthcare system. At all!

"> Stalin did the same to buy time, since by then he thought he would have to fight Nazism alone.

I think it would be more accurate to say he wanted to avoid the war altogether. There is quote of him saying something along the lines of ""let the Europeans fight amongst themselves, we need to get on with building socialism"", im loosely paraphrasing as I forget who he was talking to, Molotov I think.

He did make a pact with Hitler, after the British, French and Polish wouldn't agree to a workable mutual assistance pact to defend against the Nazis.  He resorted to appeasement in a ultimately futile effort to keep the USSR out of war with Germany.  And it was appeasement, the USSR was shipping vast quanities of raw materials to Nazi germany right up until the invasion (supplies that would ironically be used to support that invasion).

I think it is wrong to say he never made a pact with Hitler, because it leaves out a important part of how he acted as a leader.  Stalin was above all things a ""by any means necessary"" kind of leader.

In a letter to Churchill he states pretty clearly his thinking on a similar issue, the American deal with the Admiral Darlan, the french Nazi collaborator.

*""As for Darlan, I think the Americans have made skilful use of him to facilitate the occupation of North and West Africa. Military diplomacy should know how to use for the war aims not only the Darlans, but even the devil and his grandmother.""*

"Yes, many enviromentalists believe that you just have to achieve political power and after you can basically manipulate the rules of distribution and capital investment in order to check various climate protection goals without having to expropriate the capitalists. There were bitter disputes in the Green Party of Germany during the 70s and 80s on this subject. The Green party began attracting many western communists who brought marxian critique to their argument. They basically said that it is utopian to believe that capitalism, whose rules of distribution of wealth are determined by the way production is organized, will ever allow itself to be impeded in it's quest for growth through rules made by politicians. 

In Germany today the liberal ecological trend is again strong, but capitalism keeps being realistic. The great industrial producers of the country have already said that if the state wants them to adopt ecological reforms, then it will have to make sure that the accumulation process remains stable, the state should basically take it upon itself to finance all private capitalist green investment in order to ensure long term profit. If we follow this liberal logic then the Green party that will govern in the future will basically have to create hereditary monopolies comprising the largest companies in commerce, industry, agriculture, mining and finance. These companies also blackmail the state by using their huge company controlled trade unions comprising a healthy chunk of the countries productive workers.

"Disagreements can often find common ground if all the information is available and media and tech companies stop controlling the flow of said information. For example welfare. If we could nail down some statistics everyone could agree on we can identify the issues with welfare and find some common ground. One thing is for sure, nothing is perfect and everything can be made better. If welfare was a company that made money based on how effectively they lifted people out of poverty the entire system would become much much more efficient and effective. If board members and data analysts crunched numbers to maximize profits by getting help to every person that needed it and getting them back into a stable position and off welfare the system would be tweaked and streamlined to be as effective as it could be. This is far from our current system. If someone is on welfare and they get a part time job they lose all of their benefits, wouldn't it make sense to ween them off, perhaps for every dollar they make they lose .50c of welfare that way having a job and welfare is actually more profitable than just a job for people struggling like you're talking about. This is a simple fix and yet it's not implemented because the goal of welfare isn't to help people it's to give them just enough to not starve but to keep them poor. Poor people vote for the party promising to help them, the poor aren't going to vote red when they are told by the blue media the red want to take away welfare entirely. Then we can address issues like how welfare is a safety net that causes more people to jump into it than to continue to struggle and climb out of a hard situation. Cultural differences matter, a lot. In most Asian cultures, education and family are above all else. Studying for test and sticking to marriage is a very high priority. Most people on welfare don't have these Cultural norms, I didn't. Mothers that are sick of fighting with fathers can always have the safety net of welfare to rely on and we can see the amount of single mother households growing along with the number of welfare cases. No system is perfect so its a situation. Does it help people? Yes. Does it also have some unintended effects that increasethe amount of people on it? Also yes. 

So then why would we want government intervention in so many other aspects of our lives when so many things they have their hands in a noticeably worse? 

If we could have real conversations with real reliable numbers and non-biased studies then we can compromise on issues. The problem is polarization and it's intended to divide. I might be right of center and you might be left of center (for argument sake, I'm not assuming) and if the information was accurate from both sides we could compromise and even if we have different opinions we could easily find ways to make things better for Americans for the most part. We have to understand there will always be victims. But the information is unreliable, biased, filled with rhetoric and nothing seems to actually help and only make disagreements more hostile.",Conservative,0

">Mao and the CPC of the time theorized and proved in practice that the proletariat doesn't have to wait for their ""bourgeoisie"" to complete this stage but rather that the proletariat can lead this revolution to it's completion while winning over other classes to defeat imperialism and it's local representatives in the country to then immediately commence the Socialist revolution. This may sound so easily grasped on a theoretical level but ignoring such a theoretical development has played out with drastic consequences when the CP of Indonesia of the 1960's took the advice the USSR and told them to disarm themselves and tail the national democrat Sukarno, resulting in their massacre. Also Stalin for all his merits gave erroneous advice to the CPC by telling them early on tail the KMT, something which he has self-criticized for.

Very true statements. I for one am not very hellbent on 2 dtage theory. I think it has some truth but it doesnt need to happen. Trotsky said this and i think thats true to a degree too. Mao was building infrastructure after the war. Although due to poor managment of the commune reps the great leap forward failed. And due to lack of training in industry a country that basically invented iron forging could no longer do it. 

>All throughout this post you tout out nothing but economism and essentially say that Socialism is just when the passes certain nice policies and reforms, which would lead me to think if AOC did such things you would support her. This touches upon one of the biggest themes of what comprises the dictatorship of the proletariat and one of the theoretical and practical shortcomings of Marxism-Leninism and it's application of Socialism in the 20th century.

Nah. I think socialism is a transitional stage between capitalism and communism. It doesnt have a one glove answer. I mean it has a direct answer. People owning means of production. But as seen in my gotha quote socialism will have the remenants of the old society economically and socially. Aoc is not truly a socialist as if she took power it would at best be social democratic and at worst capitalistic as she would have to work with republicans rather than purge those bastards and pop the firing squad on btch mcconnell. There are shortcomings to ml theory. This post is not saying everyone we must do exactly like them. We can go further. But i dont think a buncha coops would help. Its very fragmented. But it is something to look at. The state and dotp is to protect the revolution. Thats its importance. Because you got fascist groups like proud boys and the alt right who would definetly seek to destroy any socialism we bring. 

>These countries while socialist or democratic in name currently present no viable alternative to capitalism let alone something to pursue especially post-capitalist overthrow especially since they have restored capitalism on their own. And furthermore, it is not good enough for something to be socialist just because it calls itself that name. However, we should remember that the people within these countries monopoly bureaucrat capitalist countries do have contradictions with their leaders and these people within them are the ones we should have any solidarity with and reject this fake solidarity with Xi Jinping or some ridiculous notion like that. Because these people are not the parties and the parties do not equal the party(after all the party can be wrong at times and must be subject to mass criticism!). And the only solidarity that we can have with them are to organize for Communist revolution within the context we live in, while being informed by the high points of the international proletarian movement of the 20th century while doing better next time around.

I dont think these are socialist nominally. They practice socialism with add ons to Marxist theory. They are defiently an alternative to capitalism. Not post as we live in a hegemony. But it shows that there is a different way. An economy can be nationalized and controlled by the people. Like i said i think many issues are in their democracy. People vote reps in who appoint leaders. Comparable to what the president does for supreme court. And thats really bad. This keeps going to the question of republicanism and democratic centralism or direct democracy. All have practical uses. But they all have cons.

>And here you are along with ""AES"" supporters putting forward such paternalistic and commandist politics. It's why even Fidel and Kim Il-Sung especially feared such a thing as a cultural revolution happening within their states because it was a fear of the masses. if this aspect isn't part of transition then it's not makign active head way into consolidating the DOTP let alone abolishing classes. Even Marx summed this up quite well when he said that the working class must take on its emancipation by themselves. Take a look at Tiananmen Square 1989 to see what the CPC thinks of any mass mobilization. 

Oh a lot to say lol. Ill put it this way. One fidel was scared people would bring back the imperial system. In fact i think cuban democracy is better than ours. I dont think fidel was detached from the masses at all. He gave back peasants land. Nationalized industry. Trained. Doctors. And housed everyone. Its impressive. You had literal agents tryinf to destroy the socialism. And fidel dodged 600 assassination attempts. You cant be blind to this. In terme of commandist. I think its more so defense of the socialist economy. People are trying to destroy it. But only power that rivals capitalist power can tangibly do something revolutionary wise. Per said in engels on authority. I think theres a critique to be made. Look at the panthers. They were doing somethint good but the moment their leaders were jailed and offed it was destroyed. Same with burkina faso. And ghana. Take out the right people and it falls. But theres also something to be said that if these people purged the informants and conspirators they would be dennounced by the western left as being authoritarian. This leftist purity is gonna ruin our movement. And thats my point.

All in all we shouldnt replicate 20th century socialism. We should learn from them. But some of these socialisms still exist. And hating on them manufactures consent to destroy socialism. The leftists that celebrated the ussr dissolution. What do we have now? No really. Ussr dissolution ia making nordic model do austerity measures. The ussr dissolution makes socialism seem like a dream. Ok. So you say bad dprk. Bad china. Bad Vietnam and cuba and laos. Then you just push war. I say support as a means of anti imperialism.

"Actually this study is heavily flawed. The top states receiving handouts red or blue are low population density states. The cost of nationwide infrastructure going through these states itself is probably higher than the citizens pay in taxes. New Mexico is a good example, which is blue and on top of the list. A interstate highway going through New Mexico helps California more than the citizens of New Mexico, but this would count towards money spent in New Mexico.  Also coastal states which lean blue have had a lot more federal money invested in them historically than the flyover states. So of course that investment is now paying dividends.  

But even if you ignore this and want to buy into the report, it is pretty much common knowledge that the richest people are Democrats, since that is the party facilitates protection of the elites from having to fairly compete with the non elites. So of course people in the red states do not have the income to compete with Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates all the other billionaires. Look at the list of all billionaires in America, they might be one or two that lean red.  

Producing a report that proves the Democrat party is a corrupt party that has stole resources from the poor and gave them to rich to prove Democrats are better isn’t really a good arguement.

Republicans are using this divide to keep power. Everything in our elections favors land over population. While conservatives are a minority, they are far more spread out. Which is why Democrats win the popular vote but Republicans win the elections so often - both in national and state races. 

Gerrymandering is just a multiplier for this effect. In NC, Dems got over 50% of the vote for state legislature but the state is so gerrymandered that Republicans actually increased the number of seats they got, which is around 60%.

But the people they're arguing with are mostly still operating under the tacit assumption that the US owns the world. 

Group A is saying, ""America HAS to invade to stop Russia!

Group B is saying, ""No they don't! They're even worse than Russia!"" 

And you're saying, ""But Russia is still bad!"" But I think what you're missing is that Group B isn't denying this.

"Functionally, this is correct, in that the collection of people who describe themselves as ""Democratic Socialists"" are often confused and self-contradictory to the point the label itself is often unhelpful. My experience has been that the majority of ""Democratic Socialists"" are just supporters of social democracy who don't understand what a difference that is.

Still have private property in your Socialism? That's not really Socialism then. The abolition of the exploitative relationship between owner and worker that ""private property"" allows is central. This also means seizing just _some_ industries makes a project not Socialism.

As for ""full democracy"", this is a misunderstanding of how a one party state operates based on capitalist propaganda that lies to you, saying that a choice between two or more parties, none of which represent your interests is somehow more democratic than electing the membership of a party that _does_ represent your interests.

Democratic Socialism is for those who want to play at being socialists and would rather disavow all past socialist projects than attempt to grapple with them honestly, largely parrotting capitalist propaganda about them people who don't understand the difference between Socialism and SocDem policy. Even the name shows both a deep misunderstanding of the inherently democratic nature of the abolition of private property and a willingness to accept Cold War propaganda.",Socialism,0

I actually used to identify as the ridiculous term “alt-lite” because I couldn’t bring myself to consciously accept that I held beliefs that were antisemitic and racist. I was prejudiced.

I went to a Montessori school from kindergarten through elementary school, and it was a pretty diverse student population for being in one of the whitest areas in America. I credit a lot of my managing to keep away from the very worst racist elements to having spent formative years with POC.

But there are several options to gasoline.  Diesel is fine, but its not really an “alternate fuel”.  The issue is that they either have less efficiency or they are not economical.

Hydrogen is cool, but you need high compression storage and it’s expensive to make.

Electric is cool but it requires mining of particular materials that cannot be locally sourced, more charging convenience, and because of that a new electric car has a higher pollution cost than a new regular car, and takes years to break even.  They are much cheaper in terms of maintenance for the end user though.

Natural gas has similar issues to hydrogen with storage and electric with no distribution network.

I hope that everyone in that convoy movement has one ounce of dignity and self respect to know that they should never ever thank a veteran for their service ever again because they don't give a damn about our veterans as they twist their knives deeper into our veterans back.

Do you know the _fear_ I had to live in thinking that this could be the day my husband catches COVID-19 and dies? He's been vaccinated 4 times but because he has a type of bone marrow failure that directly limits the amount of healthy white blood cells he can make which means, even though he is fully vaccinated, he can still die.

And if a cancer patient can be vaccinated then so can all those whiny entitled assholes, who refuse to do the bare minimum for others in this society.

It ain't that hard of a choice to make. And if they seriously don't want to get vaccinated then they shouldn't be in a job that they can easily spread the virus to others.

">Why would the implementation of the UBI necessitate the abolition of social services

It doesn't, but that's what will happen. Bourgeois politics works that way, please remember that empirically speaking, policy in most capitalist countries does not correlate with public opinion. I think it only correlates with the opinion of, as examples, the top 1% in the US and the top 10% in Germany, trending downwards. If UBI gets implemented that will be its purpose.  It's neat that you want to use it for good but in liberal democracies that will not happen.

Also that ""nationalizing important industries and regulating non-essential ones"" is basically [socialism with chinese characteristics]( barring of course the end-goal being full socialism once the capitalist mode of production has outlived itself.

Also btw, socialist nations are [really]( [good]( [at]( [innovation]( after all, most basic research into innovation is state funded even in capitalist countries.

&x200B;

>What are the inherent contradictions within capitalism?

From the [labor theory of value]( the [law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall]( follows. Then there's the contradiction between the interests of the [public and private capital]( The fundamental contradiction of course it that the members of the working class have diametrically opposed interests from the capitalist class (see LTV). [Here's a good collection of additional contradictions](

&x200B;

>A bit concerned by how the guy quite literally praises Mao, Lenin and Stalin

You say that you get that the red scare has left its mark ([and it really, really has]( but you still uncritically accept that these are Voldemort-like figures that have somehow been able to gather popular movements behind them while being cartoonishly evil? And don't bring up the fascists, that was not a popular movement but a [capitalist one]( These people were responsible for, respectively

* Mao: Taking China from a feudal, colonial, subjugated territory to a sovereign, self-determined nation, doubling the life expectancy of the people and starting the government that has lifted 800 million people out of poverty. Please remember WMDs, the Nayirah testimony and Assad gassing his own people when you consider the narrative you've been told about China. The [most popular]( one being tiananmen, but there's [a lot]( of these stories around. The Chinese populace participates in legislations, elects the first level of representatives and is allowed to protest on most matters except of course separatism or overthrowing the government (honestly quite normal)
* Lenin: Formulating [revolutionary theory]( and [predicting modern imperialism]( As well as starting a revolution that again took a monarchist, feudalist state into a modern nation, [improving]( the lives of the people massively and giving the workers of the world an example to look up to.
* Stalin: Being a leader to the USSR in times of extreme upheaval, leading in [centralization and industrialization]( and also being a wartime leader, saving Europe from fascism. [The CIA admitted]( he wasn't a dictator, just a leader. The russian people today have a positive view of him for a reason. Here's a pretty [nuanced]( discussion on him if you're interested. He was not perfect leader and he likely caused not a few deaths that shouldn't have been, but he saved many, many more by modernizing the USSR and beating away the fascists. Oh and he also was big against[racism and antisemitism]( and was the founder of the ethnic minority autonomous regions. You should beware anyone comparing him to Hitler, as they are likely trying to downplay the evil of fascism and relativize it as a viable alternative to socialism.

Take whatever of this you want, as long as you gain *some* nuance in your view of these people it's a gain in my book.

"I think, just like everything else, it's very easy for things to be misunderstood. Yes, European countries, such as the various Nordic ones, are all still under capitalism. Yes, the various dictatorships like Cuba and the USSR were socialist. But that's not really the way people use those terms when discussing them.

If someone told you they wanted to implement more capitalist policies, what's the image you'd go to? Probably something along the lines of more privatization, less workers rights, and things like that, despite the fact that capitalism on its own doesn't imply any of that. Similarly, when someone says they want to implement more socialist economic policies, they don't usually mean they want to confiscate private businesses to make them publicly owned, despite that actually being a socialist economic policy.

Yes, words do have meaning, but in most situations, it is far more helpful to talk about things in terms of what the common understanding of a word is and not its dictionary definition. When Americans say ""socialism"" they mostly mean ""liberal welfare capitalism in the vein of the Nordic model."" When Americans say ""capitalism"" they mostly mean ""unregulated lasie faire capitalism of the 1920's."" And when they say ""communism"" they mean ""Soviet era collective socialism."" 

It doesn't help the discussion for either side when they're using different definitions for the same word and I think this is where the disconnect lies among these Latino voters. They see socialism and think ""Cuban dictatorial socialism"" when that's not at all what liberals in the US mean when they say it. Just the same, it's not helpful for our discussion here or in broader politics to say that sort of socialism is what American liberals mean when they say socialism, like in this thread. Just the responses in this comment chain make that pretty clear.

"As a friendly reminder, China's ruling party is called Communist Party of China (CPC), not Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as western press and academia often frames it as.

Far from being a simple confusion, China's Communist Party takes its name out of the internationalist approach seekt by the Comintern back in the day. From [Terms of Admission into Communist International]( as adopted by the First Congress of the Communist International:

>18. In view of the foregoing, parties wishing to join the Communist International must change their name. Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party’s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official “Social-Democratic”, or “socialist”, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker. 

Similarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.

"I’m not trying to say that Russia is entirely good and deserves our support but I think the situation requires a bit deeper of an analysis and it’s a bit reductive to just say that both sides are bad and that be the end of it. Yes Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 but this isn’t necessary an aggressive act we have to look at the historical context. Crimea has for the past ~250 years been a territory of Russia and In 2014 68% of the population was Russian and only 16% was Ukrainian. Crimea was made a republic of the Soviet Union in 1921 and then in 1954 it was transferred to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic only becoming a part of the modern day Ukrainian state in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union. Crimea was home to one of the largest naval bases of the Soviet Union and one of great strategic importance being located on the Black Sea. After the fall of the Soviet Union and Crimea’s absorption into Ukraine the Ukrainian government and Russia came to an agreement on who would be able to use the base. Ukraine agreed to lease the base to Russia while still having the land as a territory of Ukraine. This lease was originally set to expire in 2017 then it was renewed in 2010 until 2042. In 2014 there was a coup in Ukraine which was openly supported by the US and western powers (and there is some evidence to suggest that they helped organize it) that was led by far-right groups including neo-Nazis groups like Right Sector. This coup installed a new president of Ukraine who is pro-American and vehemently anti-Russian. Seeing that they would likely lose access to their naval base that had already been leased to them until 2042 and fearing for how this new far-right anti-Russian Ukraine would treat the people of Crimea being that it was comprised of a majority of ethnically Russian people there was a referendum put forth to the Crimean people asking them to vote on if they would like to break off from Ukraine and join Russia after Crimea's parliament had voted to seek annexation by Russia. The Results of the referendum were overwhelmingly in support of joining Russia with exit poles done by Crimean officials reporting a 90+% of voters in favor and having voter turnout rates of 80+%. So Russia annexed Crimea, a region that has historically been a territory of Russia, to maintain control of a very strategically important naval base and protect ethnic Russians from far-right oppression in response to a US backed neo-nazi led coup and a vast majority of the Crimean people were in support of this. Idk but to me this doesn’t seem like an aggressive move. The US has been constantly expanding its sphere of influence East ward via NATO and Russia just seems to be acting defensively to try and stop their expansion and maintain their global position. Yes Russia is amassing troops at its border in response to NATO trying to bring Ukraine into the fold but which of these moves is the aggressive one trying to expand your sphere of influence to the boarder of your enemy or moving troops around within your own country? It seems to me that at almost every turn the US has been the aggressor while Russian is just trying to maintain what it already has. And while I understand the thought process behind saying it doesn’t really matter they are both capitalist powers that need to be overthrown I think it would be much harder for Russian communists to build a revolutionary movement while being involved in a major conflict with NATO. I think we can both agree that this war needs to be avoided at all costs and it would only lead to massive amounts of death and suffering for working class people but for that to happen we need to understand the context surrounding this conflict and really see who the major aggressor is. If the international and local leftists can clearly see the situation and who the major aggressor is it will be easier to direct our efforts on putting pressure against mainly that nation and hopefully avoid war. I personally don’t believe Russia wants this war so I don’t think there needs to be as large of an effort pressuring them to avoid it but I am completely open to further discussion and hope we can have a constructive conversation on the topic as their is a lot of nuance and different perspectives that need to be taken into account.",Socialism,2

">Working class people may not have read through all these dense Marxist books to have the context, but the intuition that North Korea is the worst of the 2 Korea's isn't going to change no matter how much ""context"" you add.

For me it doesnt matter which of the koreas is better. The lies of the dprk add to horrid sanctions meant to invoke suffering. Thats what we need to get across. Take the taliban in Afghanistan. Am i a fascist? No but i think sanctions are inhumane. We are gonna starve the Afghan people out of revenge and spite. So we should have solidarity with afghan people and not just chalk afghans issues on them being fascists. I mean thats true but 98 percebt of people there are poor. And hunger is rising.  

Now i think the dprk is better than the Taliban. By like a million times. But the same thought goes. Economic sanctions purposely starving a 3rd world nation is cruel and a form of active warfare. If we the left call ourselves anti imperialism we must be anti imperialism. Thats why china trades with taliban but does not acknowledge them. China is more humanitarian than the us. 100 percent. If people believe in human rights then they must stop this warfare.

>I don't critize or cut down other real world attempts at socialism, but I'm sure as hell not going to support them and hold them up as something they are not.

Moreso my point is to show solidarity. The black panthers showed blatant solidarity with maoist chiba, the ussr, dprk and vietnam. We have settled for milquetoast socdem bullshit and not get to the root core of the usa economy and its globalist economy.

"My position on this is that Democrats should only favor federal (national) legislation on electoral reforms to eliminate or reform gerrymandering, preferably as part of a larger electoral reform package like the For the People Act, which also would have addressed voter suppression and various other issues, had it passed, and that Democrats should oppose state level anti-gerrymandering efforts.
  

  
When Democrats successfully pass anti-gerrymandering legislation and constitutional amendments to state constitutions in blue states who's governments they usually control, they are practicing unilateral disarmament that leads to Republicans gaining seats in every red state Republicans control that the percentage of voters who support the Republicans in those states don't justify, while Democrats are limiting themselves to simple fairness in blue states, created gross unfairness when looked at in the overall context of national redistricting and the state of the House of Representatives as a whole.
  

  
As long as red states gerrymander in favor of Republicans, blue states can and must gerrymander in favor of Democrats.  Our party's split personality on this issue has led us to a some awful overall national redistricting years that have yielded things like a 2012 election where with every House seat in the nation up for grabs, the majority of voters nationwide voted for Democrats, and the Republicans kept control of the House, holding 234 seats to the Democrat's 201 seats.
  

  
One can't run state level redistricting processes of a federal legislative body (the US House of Representatives) without contexting them with the national state of affairs.
  

  
The fact that Democrats are generally against gerrymandering in theory, but often pursue it at the state level does not make them hypocrites, it makes them pragmatists.  Democratic gerrymandering in states like New York is not the problem, if anything it's the Democratic efforts that have given the courts a state constitutional clause to potentially wipe out the gerrymander with that's the problem, because as long as Republicans oppose national anti-gerrymander efforts, Democrats must gerrymander in the states that they can do so just to create anything even approaching a national playing field that represents the will of the people.
  

  
If Republicans don't like the districts in the few states Democrats have gerrymandered, they should join Democrats in supporting national legislation to end gerrymandering in this country as a whole.  That is the only fair way to do it.",Democrats,0

"As I wrote:  I've been a teacher, and I have no love for administrivia.  Having said that, most of that paperwork and record-keeping is the result of gate-keeping by public school teachers unions lobbying to protect union jobs rather than ensure quality education for children.  With all the resources we throw at public schools we ought to have the best-educated populace on Earth.  The question is, ""Why don't we?""

I taught in a private Christian school, and none of us had degrees in education. Only one guy even had a state teaching license.  What we *did* have was highly educated and highly motivated people with years (or decades) of real-world experience who were passionate about the mission and had rock-solid knowledge about our subjects. Our students were *years* ahead of the kids in the public schools in our area even though the families were demographically similar and our per-pupil budget was a fraction of theirs.

Throwing money at public schools doesn't make them better. Doing paperwork doesn't make them better.  Hiring and promoting based on ""education"" credentials doesn't make them better. If those things worked we would see very different results. Teaching just isn't that hard if you're good at it, and if you're not good at you probably shouldn't be doing it. (Edit: if you *are* good at and just hate the self-inflicted pain, go work at a private school where the focus is on educating students rather than checking boxes... just be aware that you're probably going to take a big cut in pay and benefits.)

*Buuuut*... because teaching is a sweet gig (except for the stuff they don't tell you about like endless paperwork and pointless rigidity in public schools), a lot of people go into it with the ideas that 1) it will be fun (and most of the time it is), and 2) that they're better-suited to form the values of kids than the kid's own parents.

COVID (ironically) tore off the mask.  Parents got to see the degree to which academics has given way to leftist ideology, and they don't like it one bit.  Stuff like this is the result:  they abused the trust and goodwill, and now they're going under the microscope.",conservatives,2
"Because you can believe in ideas like leftism, anti-imperialism, etc for their ideals, or you can do it because you oppose something that leftists are opposed to.

Its basically just fascism. There are people who oppose the West not because they believe it to be anti left, imperialist or neoliberal, but simply because they oppose it. So they attach themselves to leftism like a parasite and start making up conspiracies, lies about their own side and just in general being inconsistent.

They often support capitalist dictatorships like Russia and state capitalist distatorships like China even though neither adheres to leftist and progressives ideals and both are imperialist nations with their own fair share of human rights abuses.

Depending on what part of the world you live in you've either benefitted from or being the victim of one of three major imperialist powers: The USA+EU, Russia or China. None of these three powers support leftism, democracy, freedom, and the only reason to equate these ideals with any of these three is not because people believe in them, but because their entire ideology is defined by its opposition to something else.",Socialism,2

"To quote the orwellfacts bot from for signing up to Orwell facts! You will now receive fun daily facts about George Orwell.

Fact 5. Orwell was far from a socialist. Frank Frankford notes:

He really didn’t like the workers… It was his attitude in discussions that I didn’t like, his attitude towards the working class. Two or three of us said that he was on the wrong side, he should be on the other side… I rather think he fancied himself as another Bernard Shaw… There was no depth to his socialism at all.
Orwell's own panicked predictions about the end of the upper middle class leave no doubt as to which team he rooted for:

Orwell was a man wholly addicted to tub-thumping socialist augury. The gentleman non-pseudonymously known as Eric Blair categorically announced in 1937 that “the upper-middle class is clearly finished.” He predicted in 1941 alone that: the British Empire would be converted into “a socialist federation of states”; the London Stock Exchange would imminently be “torn down”; Britain’s country homes would be transformed into socialist “children’s camps”; and Eton and Harrow faced immediate post-war closure.

And another one:

Pew says: While Americans are more favorable toward NATO than not, partisans hold very different views of the alliance. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are much more likely than their Republican counterparts to have a positive assessment of NATO (77% vs. 44%, respectively). But within each partisan coalition in the U.S., there are few differences by ideology. Conservative Republicans are about as likely as moderate or liberal Republicans to have a favorable view of the organization. The same holds true for Democrats: Liberals are no more likely than conservative or moderates to have a positive view of NATO.



Good on article about how nato has its image, here’s the abstract;

International Relations scholars often assume that NATO represents the institutional expression of a pre-existing, liberal-democratic Western security community. However, far from simply representing a pre-given community, NATO has always been involved in power-filled processes of constructing “the West.” At the heart of those processes lie practices of collective (re)imagining of the Western world, as well as the representation of internal tensions as feuds within a community united by liberal values. Today, the task of managing internal differences has become particularly complicated due to the rise of radical conservative political forces in several allied states. This has translated into an unprecedented clash between liberal and illiberal interpretations of the Western community. This paper also shows that, contrary to conventional wisdom, middle powers have played important roles both in the construction of the liberal Western security community, and, more recently, in articulating an alternative—radical conservative—vision of the West.

"I think that Euroscepticism was the correct class position to take at the time, and it remains so. 

The EU is a constitutionally neoliberal transnational club of national bourgeoisies who were driven together during the closing phases of the Cold War amidst the emergence of a monopole world under the dominance of the US. Historically, its role has been to paste the class interests of one fairly narrow sector of the European bourgeois (German manufacturing capital, French agriculture, and the banks of both) over those of the entire continent. 

The relationship of the Eurozone centre with that of the periphery is one of only barely disguised imperialism. The imposition of a common financial policy (determined by Northern and Western European financial elites) upon the Southern and Eastern periphery facilitated massive capital investment flows from the West to the East - but largely in the form of FDI and tourism which facilitated the extraction and repatriation of profits rather than any sustainable development. The resulting structures created economies (particularly the PIIGS nations) that were based more or less entirely on limitless credit with no sustainable system of domestic taxation. 

When the chips were down after the whole show fell to pieces after the 2008 financial crisis, Troika went to war with the South European working-class, imposing austerity in return for bailouts. One might think that this was a tough but fair policy - *but those bailouts didn't go workers*. They were immediately paid back to German, French and British banks in the form of debt servicing. Effectively, the EU presided over one of the largest money laundering schemes in known history, where it soaked up the losses for the entire financial aristocracy of Europe, leaving starving workers in Southern Europe on the hook.

Far from 'guaranteeing' workers rights, the EU has been at the forefront of smashing them to pieces when circumstances demand. The EU did not lift a finger to strike down the Bedroom Tax or benefits sanctions or work capability assessments. It's only the political organisations of our class which defend us, not surrendering our political autonomy to capitalist technocrats. I think we should all choose proletarian solidarity and transnational organisation of the working-class over imperialist solidarity between bourgeoisies and transnational co-operation between our enemies.

There are plenty of other reasons why we should be Eurosceptic - both in principle (eg the EU's racist Fortress Europe policies, it's patronage of fascists in Ukraine, its cosiness with Saudi Arabian theocracy, its indifference towards Palestinian apartheid etc) and tactically (it caused a unfolding political crisis that brought down two Tory govts and brought Labour within a few thousand votes of winning the 2017 election). But that is more than enough alone to validate the correct political instincts of workers in the UK to reject the EU.",Socialism,2

"Cont'd from above^

>2 stage theory is what i think is most important to talk about. So for marx and lenin socialism is a transitional stage between capitalism and communism. And for lenin a poor fuedal or colonized nation needs to pass through 2 stages to reach communism. Stage 1 capitalism. And stage 2 socialism. So lenins NEP was state capitalist. He gave peasants land and a market and thus private property to build productive forces. Now people throw that term a lot so what is it? Those are the physical conditions for socialism. Because marx showed that socialism arises from the ashes of capitalism and industrial society due to capitalisms ability to create tons of wealth this makes sense why lenin would develop 2 stage theory.

Firstly, with the experience of the Chinese revolution the two-stage theory of revolution has advanced beyond what Lenin theorized and the difference here being that while semi-feudal, semi-colonial countries must pass through the bourgeois-democratic stage, Mao and the CPC of the time theorized and proved in practice that the proletariat doesn't have to wait for their ""bourgeoisie"" to complete this stage but rather that the proletariat can lead this revolution to it's completion while winning over other classes to defeat imperialism and it's local representatives in the country to then immediately commence the Socialist revolution. This may sound so easily grasped on a theoretical level but ignoring such a theoretical development has played out with drastic consequences when the CP of Indonesia of the 1960's took the advice the USSR and told them to disarm themselves and tail the national democrat Sukarno, resulting in their massacre. Also Stalin for all his merits gave erroneous advice to the CPC by telling them early on tail the KMT, something which he has self-criticized for. Even such opportunist elements part of the Pink Tide refuse to learn from such historical universal lessons from particular experiences and feed into this illusion that they can build ""socialism"" or even a complete a ""democratic revolution"", without confronting imperialism head on. New Democratic revolution says that when the working class are at the lead they are the ones who can defeat imperialism along with completing it's economic tasks. So Mao took something which Lenin developed and elaborated further on it in practice. 

Furthermore, the NEP was only a *temporary* **policy** whose sole task was economic restoration after the civil war. It was not a revolution like a New Democratic phase entails. Conflating the NEP and the first stage in a two-stage struggle within a semi-feudal, semi-colonial state actually prolongs the development of the productive forces to an indefinite time period, something with very early on national bourgeosie representatives under the New Democratic period were urging for because they wanted to move towards capitalism, instead of full on socialist construction which both the policy and the NDR are supposed be superseded by immediately after. 

>And the theory of leninism is vanguardism, dictatorship of the proletariat, democratic centralism and 2 stage theory.

>And this is rhe 2nd world superpower.

All throughout this post you tout out nothing but economism and essentially say that Socialism is just when the passes certain nice policies and reforms, which would lead me to think if AOC did such things you would support her. This touches upon one of the biggest themes of what comprises the dictatorship of the proletariat and one of the theoretical and practical shortcomings of Marxism-Leninism and it's application of Socialism in the 20th century. The problem was that these countries did and still take this paternalistic approach to socialist construction where the masses do not play an active role in the transformation of Socialist society on a day to day level on the things that effect them small and large. You mention all these things about the PRC but they are decreed from above and while the Party it only represents a fraction of the population the vast majority of the population only plays a passive role in existing and not moving the class struggle forward. That's how the monopoly bureaucrat bourgeoisie was able to restore capitalism so quickly in the USSR because the masses were not used to being mobilizing on their own initiative, which speaks to the lack of the CPSU and also the CPC's mass line and more to their commandism and top down approach. It's not a small coincidence that you talk about only the development of productive forces and talk nothing about the qualitative change in how the proletariat exercises it's dictatorship. The only time period which saw an attempt to address this was the Cultural Revolution period which tried to use more than decrees to make changes in the superstructure but actually relied on mass mobilization and mass movements as the chief form. The CPC are not interested in this because they know unleashing the masses and politicizing them in their interests and for them to act on these interests in an active and not passive way would mean the mass criticism of billionaires and their bourgeoisie supporters in the party. And here you are along with ""AES"" supporters putting forward such paternalistic and commandist politics. It's why even Fidel and Kim Il-Sung especially feared such a thing as a cultural revolution happening within their states because it was a fear of the masses. if this aspect isn't part of transition then it's not makign active head way into consolidating the DOTP let alone abolishing classes. Even Marx summed this up quite well when he said that the working class must take on its emancipation by themselves. Take a look at Tiananmen Square 1989 to see what the CPC thinks of any mass mobilization. 

These countries while socialist or democratic in name  currently present no viable alternative to capitalism let alone something to pursue especially post-capitalist overthrow especially since they have restored capitalism on their own.  And furthermore, it is not good enough for something to be socialist just because it calls itself that name. However, we should remember that the people within these countries monopoly bureaucrat capitalist countries do have contradictions with their leaders and these people within them are the ones we should have any solidarity with and reject this fake solidarity with Xi Jinping or some ridiculous notion like that. Because these people are not the parties and the parties do not equal the party(after all the party can be wrong at times and must be subject to mass criticism!). And the only solidarity that we can have with them are to organize for Communist revolution within the context we live in, while being informed by the high points of the international proletarian movement of the 20th century while doing better next time around.",Socialism,2

Why are Democrats supporting groups that burn and loot small business’s, but condemn truckers in Canada who have burned and destroyed nothing. Have actually shoveled snow off the streets and pick up the trash behind themselves. Not really standing by the working man are they?

Why have Democrats opened the southern border allowing a flood of low wage workers and drugs to spread throughout the US, displacing the working class form their jobs and killing them with drugs?

Why did Democrats force small businesses to close or limit business when the Covid outbreak began, but determined the big box stores was essential?

"Corruption is an essential feature of capitalism, though. In the imperial core it is merely called lobbying, as we like to think of ourselves as more civilized when doing such things. It's basically the ""expat"" vs. ""immigrant"" divide but for buying politicians. The difference is that in both the imperial core and in the imperial periphery it's done in the interests of the imperial core bourgeoisie.

The countries of the imperial periphery are set up for extractive economies and thus the main intent of imperial powers is to keep the cost of resource extraction as low as possible. Allowing a stabilization of the local economy hurts that intent. 

I don't disagree that poor monetary policies and corruption are problems in neocolonial states, I just think that these are not fixable within the framework of liberal democracy or foreign-backed autocracy in these countries. Liberal democracy is quite literally designed to be easily corruptible, that is why it's the form that most capitalist countries inevitably take.

"Excellent link, thank you. I'm adding it to similar articles I've saved. Defenders of Garland point to his Jan 6 statements about following the evidence and the law, but that statement, when read, was very carefully crafted to be vague about who exactly would actually be prosecuted.

He just made a statement recently that further specifies going after even those who weren't there on Jan 6, if they're found to have been involved. But I still think it skirts specifics. He needs to clearly say he's willing to file charges against sitting members of Congress and even cabinet members or the ex president himself.

It costs nothing to state what should be an obvious statement of law - that no one is above it. And he hasn't.

The Justice Dept hasn't reached out to Georgia's sec of state’s office about Trump asking to “find” enough votes to reverse his defeat. Yet a local district attorney *is* investigating it. Why aren't journalists asking spokespeople for JD about that?

Additionally why hasn't the Trump campaign received requests for documents and interviews from the FBI or Justice Department related to Jan 6?

Why haven't federal prosecutors attempted to interview those who have knowledge that Trump considered a plan to put in an AG that was more pliable about going after his claims about massive voter fraud?

Every talking head on national news, point to Trump's speeches where he aggressively encouraged protestors to go to the capitol, and say the AG would have a hard time using that to prove he directly incited the insurrection. 

But none of them talk about what he *did*. Pressuring the Georgia sec of state, his plan to install a puppet AG, and many other acts *would* be enough to establish that. And Garland is apparently making no effort to investigate those.

"I agree and disagree. I do think we need to start changing our behaviours now to an extent. Mainly so we can become human beings who can exist in a less consumerist society in the hope that someday things might change, prepared for this new society.

"Why are they (liberals) so dedicated to masking kids in schools? The last time I checked less than 1,000 kids under 18 have died of Covid. And many of these had underlying health issues. The science shows that kids are the least susceptible to Covid. On top of this it’s been proven that cloth masks are next to useless at preventing the spread of Covid. So what is their end goal? Other than stupidity why are they digging their heals in on this? They have to know it’s politically a loser.",Conservative,1

"Prior to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact the USSR tried to negotiate and anti-german alliance with France but the French refused.  Additionally on 1938 the French and British carved up Czechoslovakia for Germany and Poland in the Munich agreement. 

When you look at the Molotov Ribbentrop pact in the historical context in which is happened, it becomes clear that it was less oppritunism and more a way provide the USSR time and a cushion to prepare for a German invasion, in the same way that the French and British attempted to appease Hitler to avoid a war. The only difference was that the USSR first attempted an actual actionable alliance that could have opposed Hitler earlier, only to have been rebuffed in 1936",Socialism,2

"Sure, but even a few thousand in tuition isn't doable for many people.  Something like 50 or 60% of Americans aren't able to cover an unexpected $1000 bill with savings.  And people don't always qualify for loans, even student loans. 

I have a bachelor's and make 75k and my wife has a master's and makes 60k (albeit as a public school teacher so she's probably underpaid).  I'm sure there are jobs that pay that with just an associate's but probably not super easy to come by, or you have to have a ton of experience to work up to that point.

It's just not as easy as people think.   And also being an HVAC tech isn't in the cards for everyone, even with the time and money to go to school.",Conservative,2
"Surely they exist. Marx and Engels are considered the founders of 'Scientific socialism' aka a conceptualization of socialism based on the principles of historical materialism. They were, however, certainly not the firsts to define themselves as socialists, see e.g. Saint-Simon, Fourier and Owen, and also after the success of their thought other relevant traditions remained, more or less distant from the Marxian thought. Now we may think of socialism as a synonyms of Marxism, but for large parts of the nineteenth century Marxist and non Marxist socialist doctrines Co-existed and often a cocktail mix of them was adopted by militants and workers. Furthermore, often Marxist and anarchists views coexisted too. We must also understand that the actual reading of Marxist works remained quite limited and confined to certain elites at the time, so even many Marxist socialists had in truth a very broad and generic meaning of what it meant.",Socialism,2
"I mean I guess that's true, but the dynamic between the Nazis and socialism is a far more diametrically opposed one while an antiimperialist government that actually serves its people in some respects should be critically supported by leftists, so using this comparison in this case is a bit harsh, rhetorically.

""No matter what classes, parties, individuals in an oppressed nation join the revolution, and no matter whether they are conscious of it, so long as they oppose imperialism, their revolution becomes part of the socialist world revolution and they become its allies."" - Mao
