I don't even disagree with that, because it isn't like the US hasn't done that in the past and it will continue to do so into the future. Weapons exist, so someone has to make and sell them. How am I doing so far? Has your assumption paid off yet?\\n\\nBefore I go on I'll just remark that I always take TYT with a grain of salt, because frankly they're a little too overtly bias for the left and I've seen them make errors. I do consider myself a leftist, probably farther left than most. Regardless I want accurate information, not preaching to the choir. \\n\\nNow that we have that out of the way. You seem to be asserting that they are saying that making weapons is bad and they should not be sold to other countries because weapons are evil anti-flower loving things blah blah blah, and that is their argument against Trump in this case. But, nothing like that is ever said throughout the video, there's nothing about denying the reality that the US makes arms and sell those arms. The main point brought up is not being a moron by having the oversight of those sales done by a department that doesn't have the experience required to determine whether or not those weapons are going to someone who could be a potential threat out of a short-sighted desire to sell more of them.\\n\\nAnd then the slightly more subjective point of how sad it is that Trump is going around trying to sell weapons to people like a door to door salesman who gets the door slammed in his face half the time because he's desperate for approval. But like I said, that's pretty subjective and not of any significant substance.  \\n\\nSo in summery, selling weapons is a reality that exists, and that's fine. Just be smart about it. And... you're ugly.
