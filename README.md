##objective
Our overarching objective is to build systems that investigate biases in social media recommendation algorithms especially in politics. To this end, we are interested in measuring political partisanship, toxicity, and hate speech on online social media platforms. Our goals are to: (1) build reliable data collection infrastructure using platform APIs or web scraping tools for Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube; (2) build machine learning models to classify political ideology and other attributes of social media posts.
